My father was Egyptian and my mother English and I have 8 brothers and sisters.
I was born Muslim but didn’t start practicing until I was twenty
when I became very devout and committed.
For the next twenty eight years Islam guided every aspect of my life.
I completed a BA in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the School of Oriental
and African Studies where I became President of the Islamic Society.
After leaving university I became Amir of a Da\`wah group
in North London and edited an Islamic magazine called ‘The Clarion’.
I wrote four books for Muslim children and spent fifteen years as a teacher
at Islamia School, the one founded by Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens).
But shortly before my 48\Sup{th} birthday I knew I no longer believed in Islam.
If you had told me a few years ago that such a thing would happen to me,
I would never have believed it and added that no ‘true’ Muslim
would ever reject Islam after having tasted the sweetness of Iman (faith).
No one who has immersed himself in the beauty of the \Quran\
and appreciated its wisdom could ever deny that it is the word of God.
If anyone had claimed such a thing I would have instinctively
doubted him and been suspicious of his motives.
But it is amazing how perceptions can change
and things I once thought unimaginable now seem perfectly reasonable.
Of course this change didn’t happen overnight.
It began a few years ago when I started to question the beliefs
I had for so long taken for granted
and started to look at Islam in a new light.

Little by little doubts began creeping in.
At first I tried to suppress them
and reacted to criticism of Islam with denial, anger and blame.
I denied there was anything wrong, felt hyper-sensitive
to criticism and blamed the West for provoking and creating problems.
When I did eventually accept that Muslims had to take responsibility
for the problems we faced,
I still couldn’t accept that Islam itself was to blame.
It was the way Islam was being interpreted that was the problem.
I started arguing for a reinterpretation and reform of traditional views,
but instead of easing my conscience,
this only highlighted the futility and dishonesty of such views.
Finally I tried to tell myself that although my rational mind
found it difficult to believe certain things in Islam,
there must be explanations beyond my capacity to understand
and that ‘God knows best’.
The safest and wisest option was to “Hold fast to the rope of Allah”.
I reckoned I had nothing to lose and everything to gain by remaining a believer
and so I went through the motions of being a ‘good’ Muslim,
in the hope that my faith would return.
But this pretence only made me depressed and lose all motivation.
The problem is that one cannot choose to believe.
Either one does or not and if there is a God,
the last thing he would have wanted me to do
was to pretend to believe in something that I didn’t.
It was quite a relief when I finally admitted to myself
that I no longer believed in Islam.

However the fact that I no longer believe in Islam
doesn’t mean I have suddenly turned into a hater of Islam.
I know that Islam brings a great deal of guidance,
comfort and worthy values to the lives of millions of people.
I know that most Muslims are good and decent people.
How could I possibly hate Muslims when my family is Muslim?
When I speak to my older children about what I think,
I tell them they must find out for themselves what they believe
and if they feel happy being Muslims then that is what they should be.
I certainly don’t feel the need to pass on my own beliefs
concerning God and religion to them —
something I felt it was my duty to do when I was a Muslim.

While I do not believe in telling anyone what they should believe,
I do think one should have the courage to honestly examine
the beliefs that are central to one’s life and guide one’s actions.
If one is truly satisfied with them,
then they should be fully embraced with one’s heart and mind,
but if they do not stand up to close scrutiny,
then they should be discarded.
Life is too short to allow it to be dictated
by beliefs one does not truly believe.

%Chapter 1:
\chapter{Have you read the \Quran?}

% [[File:Baby_Hassan.jpg|250px|center]]

Every night, before going to bed, we recited \emph{al\–Fatiha},
the short first chapter of the \Quran.
I felt God was watching over me.
My father, or more usually, my mother, would stand at the door,
while my two brothers and I folded our arms and sat up in bed.
We recited it at lightening speed in Arabic and English,
then heads down, lights out.
Sometimes I also added my special prayer quietly to myself;
\emph{“Please God, make everything alright”}
I was too tired to go through the details.
God understood.

The only times we had to say the formal daily prayers was on special occasions,
like a visit from Granddad,
when we had to make a big show of religious piety for his benefit.
After praying, my eldest sisters, Kamelia and Suzy showed me
how to make Du\`a (supplication) to ask God for anything I wanted.

\begin{quote}
“Hold your hands out and don’t leave any gaps!” Kamelia said.

“Why do I have to put my hands like that?” I asked.

“So that you can catch the presents God is sending you!” Kamelia answered.
\end{quote}

I accepted that reply without question
even though I could not see any presents.
I was becoming familiar with God’s way of doing things.
If I asked God for a bicycle, I knew it would not come immediately
and perhaps may never come at all.
It wasn’t God’s fault, but because I had been naughty in some way
and didn’t deserve it.
When I wanted something very badly I would try very hard
to be good for as long as possible.
I did that when I asked God to make mummy and daddy stop fighting.
When they didn’t stop I knew it was because I wasn’t good enough.

% [[File:Hassan_Boy.jpg|200px|center]]

As I got older, Islam receded further and further into the background
and by the age of twelve, during the long hot summer of 1971,
my only concern was to be like Marc Bolan.
With my curly hair, velvet jacket and platform boots,
I thought I looked like him too.
A dab of glitter on my cheeks and I was away,
pouting and prancing in front of the mirror to ‘Hot Love’ and ‘Get it On’.
I drew pictures of him and Mickey Finn
and stuck them on the wall of the bedroom I shared with my two brothers.
Our bedroom became so covered in drawings and pictures of men in make-up
and tight-fitting leotards from ‘Oh Boy!’ ‘Pop Swap’ and ‘Jackie’
that my father was convinced we were becoming queer.

\begin{quote}
“What on earth are all these homosexuals doing on your walls?”

“They’re not homosexuals.”

“Of course they are; just look at his eyes,”
he said, pointing to a picture of Dave Hill, the guitarist from Slade.
\end{quote}

I studied his eyes carefully, trying to determine exactly what it was
that transmitted “HOMOSEXUAL” so plainly to my dad.

\begin{quote}
“They all wear glitter; it’s just for show!”

“I want you to take them down. Now!”
\end{quote}

We did as we were told.
One didn’t argue with my father.

% [[File:Hassans_Father.jpg|450px|center]]
% My father, Aziz (far right) during the war against Israel 1948.

Born to a wealthy Egyptian family,
my father rarely talked about the country
and culture he came from and wasn’t very religious.
For a long time I never knew he was from Egypt.
When he first came to England he called himself \emph{Jean Pierre}
and told everyone he was French.
My mother, Mary Magson, was the daughter of Horace Magson,
an accountant from Darlington.
Her family were Methodists, but like my father, she wasn’t religious.
The two of them met in Paris in 1951.
He was studying at the University of Lausanne,
while she was in the ATS where she’d driven ambulances during the War.
After getting married they went to live in Egypt,
but as a result of the 1952 revolution and the Suez Crisis,
the British Government evacuated them
along with other Anglo-Egyptian families.
They were resettled in an old Tudor cottage in the middle
of the Suffolk village of Coddenham,
where I was born on the 12\Sup{th} of May, 1959,
fifth child in a family of eight.

% [[File:Hassans_Mother.jpg|250px|center]]
% My mother, Mary Magson (standing) in the ATS during WW2.

We moved to Finchley in North London when I was 6 years old
and that is where I spent most of my childhood and teenage years.
During the 1960s it was a very white middle-class area
and I soon became aware that we didn’t quite fit in.
I hated telling someone my name.
It was always the same reaction,
an embarrassing silence and a confused or mocking expression.
My class teacher once made a list of religious affiliations.
When he called my name out I hesitated for a long time,
which of course only attracted more attention.
Eventually I whispered Muslim.

\begin{quote}
“What?” said my teacher.

“Muslim, sir.”
\end{quote}

Some children sniggered.
One boy insisted that ‘Muslim’ wasn’t a real religion at all
and I had made it up.
My siblings and I became a target for bigots and bullies.
This wasn’t helped by my father’s insistence
that we were to be withdrawn from school assemblies.
I don’t really know why he wanted to withdraw us.
I could better understand it if he had been religious,
but the only effect it had was to confirm to everyone
that we were ‘different’ and should be treated as such.
Instead of listening to the parable of ‘The Little Red Hen’
or singing ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’,
which my father thought would infect my mind with Christianity,
I was exposed to the delights of a pornographic novel
which the older boy next to me was reading
as we sat in the room assigned for those who opted out of assembly.

My father was full of paradoxes and contradictions.
In some ways he was very liberal-minded and in other ways ultra\–conservative.
His attitude towards women was very old fashioned
and he expected my mother to stay at home, cooking,
cleaning and looking after his children
and he became violent if he felt she wasn’t obeying his every command.
After suffering for many years my mother eventually sued for divorce.
The court battle over custody of the children was long and bitter.

% Me & Diane 1978

At the age of 18 I started a degree in Sociology
at the Polytechnic of North London,
a hotbed of Marxists and Trotskyite student militants.
I joined the Broad Left, one of the two main Socialist parties
at North London Polytechnic and was appointed cartoonist
for the college magazine, “Fuse”.
Our main rival at the Polytechnic were The Socialist Workers Party
and I drew many scathing caricatures of the leadership,
lampooning the ridiculous things they said,
their lack of dress sense and poor personal hygiene.
My cartoons were unanimously praised until I drew one
criticising my own party — the Broad Left.
The Editor took such offence that I was sacked on the spot.
I had contravened the most basic rule of politics — stick to the party line.
But I had never been one for sticking to any party line
and my experience with left-wing student politics
only served to alienate me from it.
I became far more interested in how to ask Diane out on a date.
Diane was a first year sociology student,
like myself and we had become fairly good friends almost immediately.
She had a bubbly and cheerful character that was easy to get on with.
She loved football, enjoyed a good debate
and we shared a similar taste in music.

After a few weeks of my shy and bumbling attempts
to say something other than “Hi”, she asked me out.

\begin{quote}
“Fancy going to the Stapleton tonight? They’ve got a live band playing.”

“Yeah! What time?”

“Come over about eight.”
\end{quote}

I was there at seven, in my best ripped jeans and smelling of Patchouli.

It was only a trip to the pub, but it was the start of my first relationship.
We became constant companions and started sharing a flat together.

At the end of the first year we’d grown tired of boring lectures
on Auguste Comte, Max Weber and Karl Marx.
Both of us had been hoping that studying Sociology
would be a creative experience,
perhaps providing clues to the great questions of life.
We were disappointed to find it was merely an exercise
in regurgitating a selection of tedious books.
We decided to drop-out and hitch-hike to Wales.
We didn’t have much of a plan beyond that.
After several days of picking psychedelic mushrooms in Aberystwyth,
we made our way to her parent’s house in Warrington to decide what to do next.

Diane had once worked as a nurse in Calderstones Hospital
for the physically \& mentally handicapped
and she suggested we both get jobs there.
Calderstones was set in a picturesque Lancashire village at the foot of,
Pendle Hill, infamous for its association
with burning witches during the Middle Ages.
I thought it was a terrific idea and we rented a small caravan
in a farmer’s field along the ridge of Pendle Hill itself.
The caravan could only be reached by walking up a very long and steep road
that began in the village and wound up into the mists of Pendle Hill.
The caravan was in an isolated corner,
surrounded by manure covered boggy fields,
where the wind and the rain never ceased.
I loved it, but Diane was not so keen,
particularly after the night I saw a ghost.
I was woken in the middle of the night
by the sound of the caravan door banging.
I looked up from my sleepy stupor towards the entrance
and saw what looked like a young girl — perhaps in her early teens —
standing at the foot of my bed.
She looked as if she was wearing rags and had a sad smile on her face.
She leant her head slightly onto the partition wall of the caravan
and stared at me.
I thought perhaps it was the farmer’s daughter,
and I couldn’t understand why she would be out at this late hour,
in freezing winter rain.
Before I could lift my head up and say something a man in a three cornered hat
appeared from behind her and ran through the caravan,
past me and disappeared out the other side.
I jumped up now and was calling out for Diane to wake up.
The girl was gone and everything was quiet, apart from the wind.
Diane was understandably freaked out and although I re-assured her
that it was just a dream triggered by the local stories of witch burnings
we’d heard along with the large amount of dope and alcohol we’d consumed,
she didn’t want to stay in the caravan anymore.
We moved out later and into a little flat in Blackburn.

It was now 1979, and I had close group of friends and a good social life.
But under the surface I felt restless and unsure of my identity.
This was highlighted now and again by the negative reaction of a few bigots,
who made it clear that someone with a funny name and foreign religion,
even though I wasn’t practicing, would never be accepted as English.
A Charge Nurse, on a ward I worked on, took to calling me “Dirty Arab!”
She started saying it from the moment she discovered my name.
She wrote on my report that I was “Dirty, lazy and inefficient”
something I only discovered much later
when a sympathetic charge nurse showed me the report.
None of what she said was true.
She didn’t like me simply because my name was Hassan.
There was no other reason.
The irony was that, up until that point,
I had never considered myself to be Arab.

Then a series of events caused me to re-think my views
about the culture and religion I had tried hard to avoid.
The first was the Islamic revolution in Iran.
I remember watching the television coverage of running battles
on the streets of Tehran, between the ordinary people
and the heavily armed guard of the Shah.
I found the images inspiring:
defiant civilians rising up against the might of a tyrant.
The revolutionary spirit of my student days had remained with me
and I instinctively saw it as a people’s struggle against a powerful elite,
but I was also aware the role religion was playing —
a religion that I felt some connection to — albeit a weak one.

I was confronted with another example of the power of religion
when my close friend John Shackleton returned from a camping trip
to announce he was now a born-again Christian.
It was an enormous shock, as he had always been so scornful of religion.
Now he refused to come down to the pub with me or listen to music —
apart from music about Jesus.
He became annoyingly exultant about his faith
and constantly attempted to convert me and Diane.

\begin{quote}
“Jesus loves you and wants to forgive you,” he said.

“But I haven’t done anything,” I said.

“We are all sinners. Jesus can restore you to how God wanted you to be.”

“Why? Did God make a mistake the first time round?”
\end{quote}

The constant onslaught of religious fervour forced me
to take a position on Christianity and religion in general,
something I had not given a lot of thought to before.
The more John explained things such as the Trinity, Original Sin,
and Atonement, the more I knew these were concepts I could never believe in.
The idea that God is “Three persons in One” and that man is born sinful
because of the sin of another or that sins can be forgiven,
not because of any meritorious act by the person themselves,
but because someone else was nailed to a plank of wood,
all conflicted with reason and my sense of justice.
John joined a small community of born-again Christians a few miles away,
but continued to visit us, praying we would be filled with the Holy Spirit.

I was unmoved by the idea of a Holy Spirit or any other supernatural power.
I had always believed that this world was ‘what you see is what you get’
and had certainly never experienced anything mystical myself.
But in keeping with the religious theme of this chain of events,
something mystical was about to happen to me.
I had been camping at the Deeply Vale music festival in Lancashire with Diane,
when we went for a walk up one side of the valley.
As we stood at the top, I heard a sound I never expected to hear.

\begin{quote}
“Can you hear that?” I asked.

“What? I can’t hear anything.”

“It’s the Muslim call to prayer… Listen!” I said.
\end{quote}

I could clearly hear the words
\emph{“Ash-hadu an la ilaha illah, Ass-hadu anna Muhammad rasoolalllah!”}
(I bear witness there is no god but God, I bear witness
that Muhammad is the prophet of God!)
They resonated with a strange clarity above the hubbub of the festival below.
Diane didn’t hear anything.
I couldn’t understand why.
Nor could I understand why someone was reciting
the Muslim call to prayer at a music festival.
I tried to think of a rational explanation,
but couldn’t come up with one that convinced me.
I began to feel that perhaps supernatural things did happen
and that this may be my own personal wake-up call to faith.

A few months later I saw Cat Steven’s on television,
giving a farewell concert.
He had become a Muslim and was resigning from the music business,
turning his back on fame and money
in order to devote his life to his new-found faith.
The public were mystified. Why would someone
who had it all want to throw it away for religion?
Religion wasn’t for cool people; it was for simple-minded, insecure people.
Part of me also had the same reaction.
But part of me felt inspired and proud.
If such a creative and respected person like Cat Stevens
saw something worthwhile in Islam, perhaps I,
as someone born with an Islamic heritage,
should take it more seriously myself.

The final episode in this series of events was
when my father turned up unexpectedly on my doorstep
to invite me to go with him to Egypt for a couple of weeks.
I had not seen a great deal of my father since leaving his house.
He had now moved to the village of Ramsbottom,
where he had been appointed Head Teacher of a residential school.
As I was living fairly near by, I took Diane to meet him.
He took an instant dislike to Diane.
She was an independent, strong-minded young woman
who wasn’t afraid of saying what she thought.
I liked that about her, but my father did not.
He didn’t like women who answered back;
it was against the natural order of things.
Women were supposed to do what men told them —
that’s the way my father believed God created them
and that’s the way my father wanted it to stay.
He set about trying to cause trouble between us
in his usual way of oblique remarks, insinuations, snide jokes,
claiming she was rude to him,
and even accusing her of stealing from his house.
I can’t be certain of whether his offer of a trip
to Egypt was part of that effort.
He had important business there regarding his father’s inheritance.
But I suspect he also thought it a wonderful opportunity
to get me away from Diane.
I told myself it wouldn’t affect our relationship and that
an all-expenses-paid holiday to Egypt was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
I think subconsciously I was also feeling bored and restless.
The area Diane and I had moved into on a newly built estate
on the outskirts of Blackburn was dull and soulless.
Our life had become full of routines and our relationship slipped into a rut.
I was eager for a change of scenery — at least for two weeks.

Before driving to the airport,
my father stopped by my sister Suzy’s house in London to say goodbye.

\begin{quote}
“What are you planning to do in Egypt, Hassan?” she asked.

“I was thinking about exploring the possibilities
of studying Egyptology at the American University in Cairo.”

“Insha-Allah,” (God Willing) prompted Suzy.

“I don’t see why I should say that, Suzy,” I replied curtly.
“Either I will study Egyptology, or I won’t.
What has God got to do with it?”

“Nothing happens unless God wills it.”

“Does he will murderers to kill people?”

“He allows it to happen because he gives us free will,” replied Suzy.

“Well then, I don’t see why God should interfere with me studying Egyptology?”

“If you say so Hassan,”
Suzy replied, wearily.
I thought about what I had just said as we drove to the airport;
it was arrogant and I regretted saying it.
\end{quote}

It was a long flight with a two hour stop-over
in a bleak East European city that seemed to be full of nothing
but grey concrete rectangles and policemen with batons.
I was relieved when we finally landed in Egypt.
The moment I stepped off the plane and into the hot,
moist atmosphere of Cairo airport,
I realized I was in another universe.
The scent of incense drifted through an intricate lattice window.
Donkeys laden with vegetables weaved their way
through an orchestra of blaring car horns;
street merchants announced their wares with a siren cry that made me jump;
men prayed on the pavement, wearing pyjamas;
and women threw buckets of peelings from balconies above.
It was a mad, chaotic patchwork quilt of smells,
noise and colour and came as quite a culture shock to me.
But despite its strangeness I soon felt at home.
For the first time I didn’t have to hide or be embarrassed about my origins.
Moreover, everyone admired and respected both halves of my cultural background.

% [[File:Hassan_Cousins.jpg|500px|center|Me & two cousins in Egypt, 1981]]
% Me & two cousins in Egypt, 1981

We stayed at my uncle’s house in Cairo.
The Egyptians wore western clothes,
watched dubbed Hollywood movies
and had many of the modern conveniences found in England.
But as I sat on the replica 18\Sup{th} Century French furniture,
a loudspeaker in the street outside began bellowing the call to prayer.
This triggered a wave of prayer calls
that slowly unfurled across the Cairo rooftops and into the distance.
Even on television, Clark Gable was cut off in mid flow,
as a sign came up in Arabic, announcing the evening prayer.
When everyone got up to pray,
I was left sitting alone at the table,
I felt a little uncomfortable.

After prayer my cousin Nihal,
who had been helping my aunty fry some food in the kitchen,
came in carrying a steaming dish.

\begin{quote}
“You like beetles?”

“Er… I’ve never had them!” I said, feeling a little queasy.

“I like them too much!”
She put the plate on the table.
“Especially I like Paul; he’s too cute!”

“Oh…” I said with a sigh of relief,
“Yeah I like them, but they split up a few years ago, you know!”
Egyptians loved everything British and knew a great deal about the UK,
though their information seemed to be about a decade old.

“Split up?”

“They don’t play together anymore.”

“Oh? Why?”

“Well bands do that after a while…”

“Georgie Best!” interrupted Hamdy, giving me the thumbs up.
“Manchester United! Good.”

“Well I support Spurs actually”

“Sopurs? What is Sopurs?”

“Tottenham Hotspur — they’re a football team.”
\end{quote}

Nihal showed me a picture in an Egyptian newspaper
of Ayatollah Khomeini hugging a little girl.

\begin{quote}
“Awww, he is such a good man!”

“The people seem to love him.”

“He says there is no difference between Sunni and Shi\`ah.
He says we are all Muslims and should be united.”
\end{quote}

Nihal was a very strong minded,
independent woman who took her freedom to do as she wanted for granted.
She didn’t wear a headscarf and had very western habits and tastes.
Yet she seemed completely comfortable about identifying with traditional,
orthodox views — something most Egyptians I met
seemed totally at ease with despite being relatively westernised.

\begin{quote}
“Eat, Hassan!” said Aunty Ola as she sat next to me.
“We made you English food: Fish and Chips!”

“Do you say your prayers, Hassan?” said my uncle.

“To be honest, no, I don’t.”

“Oh you must pray!
Prophet Muhammad said that ‘Prayer is the key to Paradise’.”

“I’m not sure I really believe in all that.
I mean why does God need us to pray?”

“God doesn’t need us to pray.
But we need to pray.
To give thanks and seek His help.”

“I still don’t see why we have to give thanks or ask for help through prayer.”

“Have you read the \Quran, Hassan?”

“A bit.”

Uncle Fouad took a book from the shelf.

“Here’s an English translation for you.
I want you to promise me you will read it.”
\end{quote}

I was reluctant to promise something I didn’t want to do,
but as I was a guest in his house I could hardly refuse.
I thought I could read a few pages then politely put it to one side.

\begin{quote}
“Thanks. OK, I will.”

“Insha-Allah,” prompted Uncle Fouad.

“Insha-Allah,” I replied.
\end{quote}

The next day my father and uncle had gone out,
leaving me at home with Aunty Ola.
So I picked up the \Quran, as promised, and began to read.
To my surprise I found I couldn’t put it down.
The \Quran\ is not like any ordinary book.
It doesn’t follow any of the conventions of standard prose.
It has no definite beginning or end.
There is no plot to follow and no neat resolution.
It seems to jump rather abruptly from one account to another.
Even its style changes with little warning,
from a steady narrative to fast paced rhyming prose.
Yet I found it strangely irresistible.

\begin{quote}
“Alif Lam Mim.”
\end{quote}

I looked up at Aunty Ola who was quietly sitting smoking a cigarette
as she read a magazine full of beautiful women strutting down a cat walk.

\begin{quote}
“What does Alif Lam Mim mean?”

“Nobody knows.” She smiled.
“Some chapters of the \Quran\ begin with letters of the alphabet.
Scholars have tried to explain them.
But nobody knows for sure.”

“You mean it’s a mystery?”

“Yes.”
\end{quote}

I liked mysteries.

\begin{quote}

“God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.
The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp:
the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass like a brilliant star:
Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the East nor of the West,

I am indeed close and answer the prayer of the one who calls on me.”

I began to cry.
I felt silly and I tried to hide my tears from Aunty Ola.
But I couldn’t stop.
I felt a strange force deep within.
I was certain it was the gentle and loving presence of God speaking to me.
It was as though a veil had been lifted and I had discovered the truth
I’d been searching for ever since I was a child.
It was a deeply spiritual and emotional time for me.
I can barely recognise the \Quran\ as quoted by the media today,
with its harsh and severe passages.
I never saw such verses at the time.
It’s not that they weren’t there,
but they never spoke to me in a literal way.

I did make a trip to the American University,
but the head of the Egyptology Department wasn’t in at the time,
and I didn’t go back.
I’d lost interest.
I spent most of my two weeks in Egypt just reading the \Quran,
with the occasional trip to meet other members
of my newly discovered extended family.
There, also, the conversations invariably turned to religion.

\begin{quote}
“A friend of mine says that only by believing in Jesus can I be saved,
because he died for our sins.”

“Islam says the opposite,” said Magdi.

“The \Quran\ says:

\emph{‘Whosoever follows the right path, benefits his own soul
and whosoever goes astray harms himself.
No soul shall bear the burden of another.’}
(\QRef{17:15})”

“Islam is the religion of our ‘Fitrah’ (inborn disposition);
it is in complete harmony with our natural instinct.”

“Then why can’t everyone see it?”

“The prophet said;
\emph{“Men are asleep and only when they die they awake.”}
That’s the nature of this world, Hassan.
If everything was clear and easy, then there would be no test.”
\end{quote}

Magdi gave me a book of Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad)
which I read from cover to cover.
One hadith in particular touched me deeply:

\begin{quote}
“(God says) I am as my servant thinks of me.
I am with him when he remembers me.
If he comes to me a hand’s span, I come to him an arm’s length.
If he comes to me one arm’s length,
I draw near to him by two outstretched arms.
If he comes to me walking, I come to him running.” (Bukhari)
\end{quote}

When it came time to return to England I didn’t want to leave
and vowed I’d be back soon.
It had been an amazing experience and I felt a sense of excitement,
as though a magical door had been opened.
I had finally found God.
I came back to England full of zeal and determination
to learn more about my new-found faith.
Diane was shocked by my sudden conversion
and felt sure it was just a passing fad.
She humoured me, hoping I’d come to my senses.
But all I could talk about was Islam.
I insisted we stop sleeping together,
explaining that Islam forbids sex before marriage.
I stopped drinking and smoking, and I began to pray regularly.
I lectured Diane about the Day of Judgment and Heaven and Hell
and the sayings of Prophet Muhammad,
trying desperately to convince her of Islam.
Eventually we both realized we were wasting our time.
Diane was not interested in becoming a Muslim
and I wasn’t going through a fad.
Our relationship was over.
I moved out of our flat, leaving behind, amongst other things,
my record collection and paintings.
I had no need for idolatrous distractions from the path of Allah.


%Chapter 2:
\chapter{The Path of Allah}

% [[File:Hassan_1980.jpg|280px|center]]

Shortly after returning from Egypt,
I was determined to immerse myself in the study of Islam and Arabic.

The awakening of my own faith seemed to coincide
with a general Islamic awakening in the world around me
during the late 70s and early 80s.
I don’t know whether this rise in Islamic awareness was prompted by events
at the time but many second generation Muslims in the UK
were beginning to \cor{re-discover}{rediscover} the religion of their birth,
after a long period of having been Muslim only in name.
There was an air of excitement and dynamism about the Muslim community,
particularly in London.
Study circles and informal gatherings sprang up
in living rooms or community centres.
Each Friday, the display window in the foyer of Regent’s Park Mosque
seemed to get ever more packed with little cards announcing new events.
Even greeting someone with Salams after prayers usually prompted an invitation
to a Zikr (Remembrance of Allah) or a Halaqa (Islamic Discussion Circle).
When I took part in such meetings
I was struck by the diversity of those attending:
Asians, Europeans, Africans, Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Malaysians and Iranians.
They came from all walks of life: civil servants, students, bus drivers,
doctors and parking attendants.
There was no barrier of race, class or nationality.
Being a Muslim was the only thing that mattered
and it granted instant membership of the Ummah (community).
The aim of the Islamic meetings was to learn about Islam,
but equally important was the social side —
getting to know other Muslims in the area
and building up a sense of brotherhood.
Gradually these meetings spawned other meetings
catering to the needs of a particular locality, ethnic group or interest.

The first meeting I began attending in 1980 was
“The Islamic Society of the Faithful”,
held alternately in the living rooms of Brother Shafiq or Brother Azim,
both Asians from East Africa and elders of the local community.
Most of us who attended were born Muslims but had not been practising
and so there was a sense of discovery and learning.
We started going through the basics of what were the beliefs
and practises of Islam.
In those days there was none of \cor{the sectarian}{sectarianism}
or other divisions that became apparent later,
none of the dogmatic insistence on this or that point of Islamic faith.
The meetings were broad-minded and inclusive.
I also enjoyed these meetings because of the wonderful food
we had at the end of them.
Na’eema, Shafiq’s wife, would serve us Moroccan \cor{cous cous}{couscous},
Lebanese stuffed vegetables or Turkish kofta, while Khaira, Azim’s wife,
would present us with \cor{biriyani}{biryani}, curry and samosas.
I loved the sense of belonging and identity this gave me.
It was like being part of a huge family that shared a special bond.

One thing that came out of the meetings of
“The Islamic Society of the Faithful”
and from discussions with almost every Muslim I met
was the importance of learning Arabic, the language of the \Quran.
I knew it was an essential step towards truly understanding Islam.
I also felt it was my duty to learn Arabic
since it was part of my heritage and identity.
I enrolled for a degree in Arabic and Islamic Studies
at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).
My tutor was David Cowan, the author of “Modern Literary Arabic”,
an elderly but sprightly Scotsman who converted to Islam in his youth.
Also at SOAS at the time were Dr.\ Wansbrough and Dr.\ Cook,
the Salman Rushdies of their day.
They had both recently published books that undermined
the \Quran’s claims to divine authorship,
Wansbrough asserting that the \Quran\ was a product of various sources,
improved and perfected through oral narration after Muhammad,
and Dr.\ Cook, along with Patricia Crone,
claiming that Islam began as a variant form of Judaism
and only much later developed into a separate religion.
Neither book engendered much of an outcry.
Today, such criticism of Islam would undoubtedly
spark worldwide demonstrations,
but the Muslim community in the late 70s and early 80s was not yet politicised.
The radical groups that exist today were only just getting started in the UK
and had yet to spread their influence.
As a young Muslim keen to soak up everything I could about Islam,
I found the atmosphere at SOAS invigorating,
and I attended every extra-curricular lecture and debate.
I also couldn’t stop reading anything
and everything that had Islam as its subject matter,
and the SOAS Library became my second home.
I stayed there studying until late into the night
and regularly had to be asked to leave by staff locking up.

In between my own efforts to learn more about Islam,
I was also busy spreading the word to others and, in particular,
to members of my own family who were not practicing.
I was motivated by an ardent desire to share what I had discovered
and to save them from hell-fire.
My two eldest sisters were already devout Muslims,
but the rest of my family was not.
It was my Islamic duty to give them ‘Da\`wa’,
which literally means ‘invitation’.
I had recently seen the film “The Message” about the life of Prophet Muhammad.
It begins dramatically, with three masked horsemen galloping across the desert
until they arrive at the courts of the rulers of Byzantium,
Persia and Egypt, to deliver letters inviting them to Islam.
This is the letter to Heraclius, the Byzantine Emperor:

\begin{quote}
\itshape
In the name of God, the Beneficent the Merciful.
I call you to Islam.
Accept Islam and you will be safe
and Allah will give you a double reward in this life and in the next.
If you do not, you will have to face the consequences.

Seal; Prophet Muhammad
\end{quote}

‘OK,’ I thought to myself, ‘if that’s how the Prophet did it,
then that’s how I’ll do it.’

\begin{quote}
\itshape
Dear Evette,

I call you to Islam. Accept Islam and you will be safe
and Allah will give you a double reward in this life and in the next.
If you do not, you will have to face the consequences.

Love, Hassan.
\end{quote}

I don’t know how Evette reacted to that letter, for she never said anything.
I decided to change tactics and focus on one-to-one discussions.
I started with my younger siblings.
I spent a great deal of time reading verses of the \Quran\
and discussing their meaning.

% {{Cmt|Regents|Regent’s}} Park Mosque.

One day I was visiting brother Shafiq,
when he suggested accompanying him on a “Tablighi Jamaat.”
Tablighi Jamaat was a movement that \cor{started}{was started}
in India by Muhammad Kandhalawi who wanted to bring Muslims
back to the path of pure Islam.
They adhere to the Deobandi brand of Sunni Islam that is followed
in large parts of South East Asia
and has a huge following in Pakistan and India.
During the 80s the group had become very popular in the UK.

\begin{quote}
“What’s Tablighi Jamaat?” I asked.

“It’s a gathering where they give talks about Islam. Why don’t you come?”

“Where is it?”

“Dewsbury.”

“Where’s Dewsbury?”

“Near Leeds.”

“Leeds? That’s miles away!”

“Oh, it won’t take long.
Come on — you’ll learn a lot and really benefit from it.”
\end{quote}

Before I knew what had happened I found myself
on a long road trip heading to Yorkshire.
After making a couple of stops to pick up some brothers,
we arrived in the little town of Dewsbury nestled in the Yorkshire moors,
with its quaint rows of Victorian terraced houses.
It didn’t seem at all like a place
where Muslims would be gathering to discuss Islam.
But as we turned a corner I was confronted
by a huge mosque at the end of the road.
Even more incongruous was the sight of little Asian children
in Pakistani traditional dress all along the street leading to the mosque,
playing with toys on the cobblestones,
while women in headscarves stood half emerged from doors
that opened on to the pavement, chatting away in Urdu.
If it wasn’t for the grey northern skies above us,
I might have mistaken it for downtown Karachi.

The mosque in Dewsbury was still unfinished and there were bags of cement
and sheets of plaster board stacked against breeze blocks,
while the main floor space was interrupted
by unfinished columns with wire mesh poking out.
The mosque was full and there were several lectures in progress.
Most of the lectures were in Urdu,
but I was taken to a gathering for English speakers.
The Maulana leading this gathering was sitting on a raised platform
and spoke in broken English to a mixed gathering of Arabs,
Africans, Malaysians and Asians — who I assumed did not understand Urdu.
On one side of me sat a chubby African man
in a colourful Kaftan and decorative hat.
He smiled and peered at me through his glasses
that had such thick lenses his eyes seemed to be twice their actual size.
Throughout the talk he continued to stare at me.
I glanced over at him — frowning slightly,
hoping he would see my irritation,
but he only grinned and stared even more relentlessly.

\begin{quote}
“Are you Muslim?” he finally ventured.

“Yes,” I replied in a hushed tone, trying not to disturb the talk.

“Mashallah! (Whatever God Wills!) How long have you been a Muslim?”

I hesitated. I wasn’t sure what to say. Technically I was born a Muslim.

“Well I’ve been practising for about a year.”

“Do you know how to pray?”

“Yes.”
\end{quote}

He thought I was a convert to Islam.
I soon discovered that English or Western converts
attract special attention from Muslims.
It was partly a protective instinct to guide the uninitiated,
to help new Muslims understand the basics.
But another reason was the sense of inferiority
that the age of European colonialism had left Muslims with.
Subconsciously many Muslims still regarded
their white European colonizers as superior beings.
The fact that a white man or woman had converted to Islam
was a special kind of proof that Islam was indeed true
and such converts received a great deal of attention.
I encountered this attitude often and found myself having to sit
and listen to lectures on the most basic and obvious aspects of Islam.
It felt extremely patronizing.

\begin{quote}
“My father is from Egypt; my mother is English.”
It was a sentence I would have to use often.

“Is your mother Muslim?”

“Er… well… not really.”

“Oh, you must try and make her Muslim.”

“Yes… inshallah…”

“It is your duty to save your family from Hell Fire!”

“I hope you don’t mind if we talk about this later, brother.
I want to listen to the talk.”
\end{quote}

The Maulana was talking about death and the Day of Judgment.

\begin{quote}
“The prophet said,
‘When a dead person is carried to his grave,
he is followed by three things.
Two of them will return after his burial but one will remain with him.
They are his relatives, his wealth, and his deeds.’”
He paused.

“His relatives will go back
and his wealth will be \cor{re-distributed}{redistributed}!”

He opened his eyes wide, “But his deeds will remain with him.”

“Yes my dear brothers, our deeds are of utmost importance.
It is only our deeds that will follow us to our grave.
They will stay with us as we await Judgment
and they will stand by us when we are questioned.
They will then either speak for us or against us.
It is then that we will realize the importance of even the smallest of actions.
But it will be too late to return and make amends.
No second chance!”
\end{quote}

The Amir began extolling the virtues of Tabligh (spreading the word of Islam.)

\begin{quote}
“What is more important than spending time in the path of Allah?
Do we truly love Allah and his Prophet more than our own selves?
Or are we too attached to the comforts and earthly pleasures of this world?
Are we so weak in our faith that we cannot even afford to give
even a little time in the service of our creator?
All you have to do is make Niyyat (intention)
for a couple of weeks or a month or a year!”

“What does he mean ‘make Niyyat for a year’?”
I whispered to the young Malaysian student beside me.

“He means you must make intention to go with a ‘Jamaat’ (group)
and invite others to Islam.”

“What?”
\end{quote}

One by one those around me got up to go.
Most had their rucksacks ready.
Some were even clutching passports and plane tickets.

\begin{quote}
“I can’t go anywhere! I have to go home.”
\end{quote}

But the Malaysian student had already got up to join a group heading for Newcastle.

I suppressed an urge to make a dash for the door
and instead tried to think of an excuse.
But after all the talk of the day of judgment
and the importance of even the smallest of actions,
every excuse I thought of just sounded like;
\emph{‘It’s OK, I don’t mind burning in hell.’}
I stood up and looked around for Shafiq,
but when I spotted him he just smiled and waved.

\begin{quote}
“See you in two weeks, Hassan!” he shouted, before exiting with a large group.
\end{quote}

The Amir noticed me looking bewildered.

\begin{quote}
“Have you made intention brother?

“My family don’t know where I am.”

“You can phone them.”

“I have to go back home. I have things to do!”

“Isn’t spending time in the path of Allah more important?”

“Well… I suppose so… but how will I eat?”

“Food will be provided!”

“How will I sleep?”

“You will sleep in the Mosque!”

“What about my mum?”

“She will be fine!”

“What about…” The thought of gripping my leg,
wincing in pain and complaining about an old war wound,
crossed my mind briefly.

“Just make intention, and Allah will make a way for you!”
\end{quote}

My intention was to go home, but God’s intention was obviously different
and I found myself being directed to a delegation bound for Leeds.
We filed out of the mosque and boarded a mini bus waiting outside.

I had never been to Leeds and consoled myself with the thought
that at least I’d be visiting somewhere new.
But apart from the mosque I saw very little of Leeds.
For the next fourteen days we ate, slept and prayed in the mosque.
I was given a sleeping bag and ill\–fitting cotton Shalwar Kameez
(long shirt and baggy trousers.)
At meal times long rolls of paper were laid down
and curry and chapattis were provided,
cooked in rotation by the members of our group,
though they only gave me washing-up duty.

We were told not to discuss politics or areas of religious dispute.
We were even discouraged from discussing the meaning of the \Quran.
On one occasion I was sitting with a brother,
trying to explain some of the Arabic words to him, when I was told to stop.

\begin{quote}
“You shouldn’t give Tafseer (meaning of the \Quran) unless you are a scholar,”
said the brother.
“Just learn by heart the Suras the Maulana taught us.”

“But then we’ll be reciting words we don’t understand?” I complained.

“It doesn’t matter. You will benefit from your recitation!”
\end{quote}

I found it difficult to see how one could benefit from reciting words
without understanding their meaning,
but I soon learnt that the act itself was considered a form of worship
that would confer blessings upon those who engaged in it.
As a result memorization of the \Quran\ without understanding it
is very common amongst Muslims,
particularly those from non-Arabic speaking countries.
(Even those from Arabic speaking countries
have problems understanding the archaic language of the \Quran.)
The majority of those with me in the Leeds Mosque
were of Pakistani or Indian origin,
and although they had memorized huge passages
and in some cases the whole of the \Quran, few could understand a word.
Memorizing the \Quran\ is not as difficult as it may seem.
The language of the \Quran\ has a poetic rhythm
with repeated phrases and patterns,
such as beginning a sentence with “Qul!” (Say!)
or ending it with two adjectives of God.
Certain stories about past prophets or parables about believers
and unbelievers are \cor{re-visited}{revisited} throughout the \Quran,
so that a sequence one has already memorized
will occur in a similar form elsewhere.
Children are also taught to read the \Quran\ from a very young age —
as soon as they can imitate sounds in some cases —
and families hold a celebration called a Khatam (completion)
once their son or daughter has read the whole \Quran.
I memorized the last Juz’ (1/30\Sup{th} of the \Quran),
which are the short Suras (chapters) at the end of the \Quran\
and which are most commonly used in daily prayers.
I also learnt several other important suras and verses
such as the last three verses of al-Baqara and al-Kahf and
“The Verse of Throne” and Suras such as “Yaseen” and “Al-Rahman”.
Fortunately my studies at SOAS helped me
to learn the meaning of what I was memorizing.

There was one book we were encouraged to understand.
It was called “The Teachings of Islam”
by Maulana Zakarya \cor{Kandhlwi}{Kandhalawi},
a large volume badly printed on cheap paper and bound in a gaudy red plastic.
We were all given our very own copy and told to study it
when we were not engaged in prayers or listening to talks.
This book was the source of many of the lectures
I heard at the Dewsbury Mosque and over the coming days in Leeds.
It related stories of the Prophet and his companions
and quoted passages of the \Quran.
The emphasis was on reaching the utmost state of piety,
abstinence and fear of God.
At first I found many of the stories strange
and disconnected from the society around me.

One story began with the heading
\emph{“The Prophet Reprimands the \cor{companions}{Companions}
for Laughing.”}
It read:

% \cmt{}{quotes must alternate when nested -> “I am a wilderness”}
\begin{quote}
“Once the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to the Mosque for prayer
where he noticed some people laughing and giggling.
He remarked: ‘If you remembered your death I would not see you like this.
Remember your death often.
Not a single day passes when the grave does not call out:
‘I am a wilderness’ ‘I am a place of dust’ ‘I am a place of insects’.
When a believer is laid in the grave it says;
‘Welcome to you.
Very good of you to have come into me.
Of all the people walking on the earth I liked you the best.
Now that you have come into me, you will see how I entertain you.’
It then expands as far as the occupant can see.
A door from Paradise is opened for him in the grave
and through this door he gets the fresh and fragrant air of Paradise.
But when an evil man is laid in the grave it says;
‘No word of welcome for you.
Your coming into me is very bad for you.
Of all the persons walking on earth I dislike you the most.
Now that you have been made over to me, you will see how I treat you!’
It then closes upon him so much so that his ribs
of one side penetrate into the ribs of the other.
As many as 70 serpents are then set on him
to keep biting him till the day of resurrection.”
\end{quote}

The author explains the purpose of the book in the forward:

\begin{quote}
“Muslim mothers, while going to bed at night,
instead of telling myths and fables to their children,
may narrate to them such real and true tales of the golden age of Islam
that may create in them an Islamic spirit of love and esteem for the Sahabah
and thereby improve their faith and that it may be
a useful substitute for the current story books.”
\end{quote}

The more I read the more acclimatized I became
to the mindset of seventh century Arabia.
After several days of confinement in the mosque
and a constant routine of talks, prayers and readings from this book,
I was so immersed in the events of the early Muslims
that I began to feel estranged from what I now regarded
as the sinful world around me.
But in spite of it’s sinfulness,
the Amir regularly ordered expeditions to this very world.
Each day he chose a group of three people to visit an address
on a list collected by brothers beforehand.
These addresses were those of local Muslims
who for one reason or another were believed to be in need of “Da\`wa” —
in other words bringing back into the fold of Islam.
I was a little anxious when finally chosen to join a group.

The Amir gave us very specific rules regarding our conduct outside.
We were not to look around at all the Haram (forbidden) things around us.
We were to keep our eyes lowered at the ground,
a couple of yards ahead of us and repeat a little prayer to ourselves.
This made it a little difficult to follow the directions,
to negotiate busy streets and cross roads.
Eventually we turned up {{Cmt|un-announced|unannounced}} at the house.
A short clean shaven young Asian let us in and offered us some food and drink,
which we politely turned down, as instructed beforehand,
in case this reprobate had used forbidden ingredients such as gelatine,
non-halal meat, or alcohol in his cooking.
We sat gingerly on the edge of his sofa, as our leader —
a leader of every group was always appointed —
repeated the talks about death and the Day of Judgment
and other stirring stories from the big red book.
We beseeched the stray brother to come to the mosque to listen to our Amir.
Eventually he agreed to join us for afternoon prayer.
Mission accomplished, we carefully made our way back.

I began slipping into a very obsessive mindset.
Even the most minute rituals and practices of the Prophet
took on extraordinary and exaggerated importance
that must be followed if I was to avoid the fires of Hell,
while all other matters of life seemed irrelevant.

\begin{quote}
“We should never think we are in any way more advanced
than the Prophet was,” said the Amir.
“Everything he did was the best example for us.
Even when we travel by car or plane we should remember
that travelling by camel or donkey is better,
because that is the way the Prophet did it.”
\end{quote}

Copying the Prophet included the way we brushed our teeth,
and our Amir gave us a talk about the importance of using the Miswak,
a twig from a type of tree found in the Middle East.
He related the saying of the Prophet;

\begin{quote}
“Was it not for my fear of imposing a difficulty on my nation
I would have ordered that the Miswak be used before every prayer.”
\end{quote}

He then produced a Miswak and demonstrated how it should be used,
stripping off the bark from the tip and chewing it until it was frayed.
He then rubbed it against his teeth from side to side.
When he had finished he told us a story from the time of Omar,
the second Caliph of Islam.

\begin{quote}
“During the conquest of Egypt,
the Muslim army was having great difficulty in defeating the enemy.
When Omar heard of this he said it must be
because of a deed they have committed.
So the Muslim fighters asked themselves
if they were neglecting any religious duty, but they found they were not.
Then they asked themselves if they had neglected any Sunnah
(practice of the Prophet) and they discovered
that they had forgotten to brush their teeth using the Miswak.
So they got together and started using the Miswak.
Once the enemy saw this,
they thought the Muslims were preparing to eat them alive and fled.”
\end{quote}

Every second of my day was now controlled and defined by this or that Sunnah.
When going to the toilet I was taught to clean myself in a certain way
and utter a prayer when entering and leaving the toilet.
Islam even regulated the way I slept,
and on my second night I was rebuked by the Amir for sleeping the wrong way.
He explained that a Muslim should never sleep with his feet pointing
towards Mecca but should always sleep facing it.
I wasn’t quite sure if he meant only that my head should be pointing
towards Mecca or whether I should be literally facing Mecca.
To be on the safe side I kept my face in the direction of Mecca
and prevented myself from turning side to side as I normally did,
which made it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep.

I became increasingly concerned that such a high level of attention to form
and detail was not sustainable outside the sheltered environment of the mosque
and worried about my salvation if I was unable to maintain it.
But it was difficult to voice this concern in an atmosphere
where group mentality strongly disapproved of any failure
to live up to the standards set.
The Maulana seemed to take pride in how hard and difficult it was
to practise Islam properly and said that Prophet Muhammad had said:

\begin{quote}
“A time will come upon people wherein the one steadfast
to his religion will be like one holding a burning coal.”
\end{quote}

The sheikh explained that in this day and age to be a good Muslim
is like clasping hold of a red hot piece of coal.
One instinctively wants to throw it away,
but one must resist the instinct and grab it tightly
if one wants to achieve Paradise and avoid Hell.
A ‘true’ Muslim had to sacrifice the comforts
and pleasures of the world for austerity
and hardship if he was to gain the comforts and pleasures of paradise.
He must expect to be thought of as \cor{a}{} weird
and strange by non\–Muslims and suffer ridicule from the society around him,
as the prophet said:

\begin{quote}
“Islam began as something strange,
and it will revert to being strange as it was in the beginning,
so good tidings for the strangers.”
Someone asked, “Who are the strangers?”
The Prophet replied,
“The ones who break away from their people for the sake of Islam.”
\end{quote}

Although I had only been at the mosque in Leeds for two weeks,
it seemed much longer, and when we got back to Dewsbury I felt disoriented
and apprehensive about returning to ‘the real world’
with its evil temptations ready to entice me away from God.
I looked for Shafiq, but he hadn’t returned.
It was \cor{during}{} Ramadan, % Grammar?
and we had been fasting all day.
At sunset everyone broke their fast together in Dewsbury mosque.
I was starving, and the curry and chapattis never tasted so good.

As soon as we had finished eating the talks started up again.
I decided to nip outside for some fresh air.
When I got outside I saw there were about fifteen or twenty men
standing in a long line around the back wall of the mosque.
They had all sneaked outside to have a quiet cigarette.
This was their first cigarette after a long day of fasting
and many were dizzy from the sudden nicotine rush,
and as a result they slurred their ‘Salams’
as they glanced at me sheepishly with glazed eyes.
Although I had been a smoker myself not so long ago,
I now felt it was very ‘un-Islamic’ and I strongly disapproved.
The fact that many had long beards and large turbans increased my indignation.
But at the same time there was a part of me that seemed to take comfort
in the fact that there were practicing Muslims who were less than perfect.
It made me feel better about the possibility
that I might fall short of being a ‘perfect Muslim’ myself.

I was delighted to finally see Shafiq the next day.
I wanted to know if he had been through a similar experience as me
and whether he too felt worried about some of the things he had heard.
But he looked relaxed and \cor{un-phased}{unfazed} by his experiences
and told me how wonderful it had been
and how he could not wait to go out on his next Jamaat.
I was relieved to get back home.
I felt a little nervous.
Things looked different.
My priorities had shifted.
I was less concerned about this life and far more focused on the next life.
I grew my beard, wore a long white Jilbab and cap.
I not only prayed all the compulsory prayers,
but I prayed all the extra prayers, too.
I began fasting every Monday and, of course,
always brushed my teeth with a Miswak.
I was also determined to keep in my mind
that heightened state of fear of God that I had felt in the mosque.
My friends and family were at first a little surprised
by the even more devoutly religious Hassan,
and humoured my somewhat obsessive attention to every tiny detail of Islam.
However I soon found that being back in the ‘real world’
gave me a more balanced perspective
and the sense of anxiety and fear gradually subsided
as I realised that Jamaatu\cor{ }{\–}Tableegh’s obsession
with form and ritual was a distorted perception of Islam.
I came to appreciate what the \Quran\ said, that
“God does not task a soul beyond what it can bear,”
and that the needs of this world
and the needs of the next world did not have to be in conflict.
I began to seek a more sophisticated and deeper appreciation of Islam than
Jamaatu\–Tableegh offered.
