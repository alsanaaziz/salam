Assalamu Alaikum,
Peace be with you,

This public repository is intended as a place to accumulate
works by authors who are part of the ex-Muslim movement.

Note: we do not espouse the radical view of extinguishing
      or eradicating Islam from the face of this planet!
      Our mission is not to agitate against Muslims, who
      are part of our families whom we love dearly.
      We simply wish to make our views of Islam and
      the conclusions we reached known to the public.
