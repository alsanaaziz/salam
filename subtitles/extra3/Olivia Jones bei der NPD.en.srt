What a joy, it's here now, the new extra3 podcast.

00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:10,713
Hello there, I'm in Hannover

3
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:15,165
and today the NPD begins its election campaign in Lower Saxony,

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,807
and I'm just going to take a look at it.

5
00:00:17,063 --> 00:00:20,288
- Hello there, we've got a euphoric atmosphere here, no?
- Yes.

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,711
["Yes."]

[She wants to get to know the election programme of the NPD.]

9
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,102
- Hello there Mr. Apfel. So I've been walking around here a bit,

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,337
it took a horribly long time until I finally found you here.

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,047
Is there anything exceptional for why I should vote for the NPD?

12
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,512
- For that please refer to the top candidate in Lower Saxony,

13
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,512
Mr. Molau will surely and gladly answer your questions.

14
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,628
[Andreas Molau is a former teacher.]

15
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:52,394
[He should be able to explain why we need the NPD at all.]

16
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,172
- So that we have a change in politics here!

17
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,388
- That is then... all right. Well, can't you be a bit more specific?

18
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,487
- So that somebody represents the German interests!

19
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:03,541
- And what are the German interests?
- Well...

20
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:07,344
- You just can't tell me why someone should vote for this party. That's the problem.

21
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,381
You only say the party is good and vote for us, anybody can say that.

22
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:11,808
- Can you read?

23
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,324
- It's just so-so.
-"It's so-so." So then we have an election programme..

24
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,357
- I'm good at doing makeup.
- Well, I noticed that.

25
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:19,709
- Why so disgusted? After all it's not a problem my little, brown bunny, right?

26
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:23,224
This is really a pity, I can't get any proper information out of here.

27
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:28,078
[The extra3 reporter is interrupted in the middle of her investigations.]

28
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:32,948
This is a beautiful scene! Okay, it's a bit cute, but they tried so hard.

Hail to Duke Widukind's tribe!

31
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,246
- I just wanted to know, there are rumours,

32
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,765
where everyone says you think Hitler is great. That's not true, right?

33
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:51,163
- No, that... err...

34
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:54,693
you know, I don't want to publicly talk about these rumours...

35
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,738
- And where do they come from?
- I'm not very keen on discussing this with you.

36
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,915
- Oh, I sure would've loved to hear about that.

37
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,817
[The reporter hasn't given up yet.]

38
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,915
- Hello there Mr. Pastör. Do I get a little interview?

39
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:10,278
You made yourself look very posh today, great!

40
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,496
I've got some questions. How's the election campaign going?

41
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:18,469
- Well, I'm not willing to, in a setting of a Brazilian carnival,

42
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,026
to give interviews. Please, respect that.

43
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:25,105
- But when one looks at your jacket, then...

44
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:28,300
it means something else, right? You also made yourself look funny, me too.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,869
- I talked... err, I talked about, that... err...

46
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:35,647
- But that wasn't the question. The question was simply how the campaign is going.

47
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,840
And still I haven't figured out why somebody should vote for this party.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,700
- Well, neither I can tell you why.

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,665
- Tell me, are you bored, too?

50
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,282
- No, not really.

51
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,199
- Somehow your hairstyle reminds me of something, I've seen that somewhere once.

52
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,202
- Tya.

53
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:54,875
- What I find strange about the NPD here — no I still got one question —

54
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,384
the proportion of women. There are no women here whatsoever, right?

55
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:01,561
Not that this is after all a gay club?!

56
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,472
Nobody knows.

57
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:07,234
All right, but there must be women here, you have to procreate somehow as well, no?

I believe this is the first party,

64
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:30,728
which starts without having a programme

65
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:33,670
and without having any points for why one should vote for them...
