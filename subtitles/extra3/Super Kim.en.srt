Now you've almost made it.

22
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,547
What remains is... your final enemy.

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,888
- Hello Super Kim, now you may import no precious luxury goods anymore

24
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:23,971
and also no totally heavy weapons.

25
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,651
- Okay!

26
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:34,694
A bit too easy? Okay, others had a much more wicked final enemy.

27
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,999
The Americans!

28
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,908
But hey, whoever has got the bomb, doesn't have to be afraid anymore.

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,463
That gets around quickly.

30
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:42,975
That's why there's now...

31
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,689
the multiplayer mode!

32
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:49,636
With Iran, Sudan and many crazy terrorists.

33
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,815
All have got the bomb now!

34
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:56,016
And when somebody doesn't have one, you can surely trade with him.

35
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:02,947
Mmmhhh, cognac!
