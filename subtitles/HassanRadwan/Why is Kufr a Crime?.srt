1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,194
Kufr means disbelief,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,542
rejection and denial of Islam

3
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:07,562
after it has been properly presented and explained.

4
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:12,103
Islamic scholars usually refer to verse 136 of Sura an-Nisa

5
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,702
for the definition of Kufr, where it says:

6
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:22,327
[Arabic recitation]

7
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:28,851
"Anyone who denies Allah, His angels, His books, His Apostles, and the Day of judgment..." (An-Nisaa?: 136)

8
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:33,709
There are literally hundreds of verses about Kufr in the Qur'an

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,938
that make it abundantly clear that not believing

10
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,798
is a terrible crime

11
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:43,208
that will be punished by eternal and excruciating torture.

12
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:44,980
These are just a few:

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:54,568
"Those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution" (3:4)

14
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:59,210
"Those who reject the Book and the (revelations) with which We sent our messengers:

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,321
soon shall they know. When the yokes (shall be) round their necks, and the chains;

16
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:08,980
they shall be dragged along. In the boiling fetid fluid:

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,379
then in the Fire shall they be burned." (40:70-72)

18
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:17,284
But why is disbelief such a terrible crime?

19
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:22,876
What exactly has the disbeliever done to warrant such appalling punishment?

20
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,384
Belief is not something we have complete control over

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,675
and one cannot simply choose to believe something

22
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:32,860
that one finds unbelievable.

23
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:38,173
For example we cannot choose to believe that grass is made of chocolate

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,574
nor can we believe that dolphins live in trees.

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,198
There are other issues that are not so clear-cut

26
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,630
where we have less evidence for example.

27
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,790
In these cases there maybe an element of doubt

28
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,050
whether to believe or to disbelieve.

29
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:58,438
Though that still doesn't mean it's a simple matter of a choice.

30
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,493
For example if I told you there were invisible fairies

31
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:06,096
living in my back garden and that I know this because

32
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,811
my great, great, great grandfather left me a note

33
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,537
which he got from them saying:

34
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,563
"Hello, we are faries

35
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,937
and we live in your back-garden."

36
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,668
Some might argue that there is an element of doubt here

37
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:23,510
since there is no conclusive evidence that faries don't exist

38
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,755
and there are actually people who believe in them.

39
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,513
But in such a case we don't simply choose what to believe.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,859
Each one of us weighs up the evidence as we see it.

41
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,126
We compare the arguments we've heard

42
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:40,876
and filter this through the our cultural references or emotional responses

43
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,338
that are are peculiar to us as a person.

44
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:47,125
We then either believe or disbelieve based on that.

45
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:50,915
Whether it turns out that fairies do exist,

46
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,865
it would be totally unreasonable to torture anyone

47
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,188
who reached the wrong conclusion.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,679
At worst they would be guilty of nothing more

49
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,055
than mistaken or faulty reasoning.

50
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:05,122
In other words, belief and disbelief

51
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:09,308
has nothing to do with being an evil or bad person

52
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:12,671
and no one in their right mind would say that people

53
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:16,494
with faulty reasoning deserve to be punished.

54
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:19,961
Some equate disbelief with being ungrateful,

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,050
but Christians, Hindus and Deists of all types would argue

56
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,154
that they are very grateful to God.

57
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:30,348
Atheists, too, would argue that they are grateful.

58
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,100
though they direct their gratitude towards the person

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,502
they perceive as responsible

60
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:38,781
rather than a god they don't believe exists.

61
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,466
So these people are not guilty of ingratitude.

62
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,027
But perhaps the most ridiculous explanation

63
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:47,347
is that kufr means people

64
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:51,128
who know Islam is true, but hide it.

65
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,584
Kufr comes from a root meaning to cover up and hide.

66
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:58,418
So they argue it implies a willful and malicious intent.

67
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,372
People who know Islam is true

68
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:03,480
but intentionally hide the truth.

69
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:07,125
If this were true, then they must be insane.

70
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:10,178
No person of sound mind would knowingly

71
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:13,519
choose to be tortured in the most agonising way

72
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,499
for all eternity. 

73
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,189
So if this is the case,

74
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,286
then Allah will be torturing mad people.

75
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,709
It is amazing how much scorn, contempt and hatred

76
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:27,251
the Qur'an directs towards Kufr

77
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:33,641
and as a result how emotive the words Kufr and Kafir are for Muslims.

78
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:37,771
Yet when you actually get past this emotion

79
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,275
there really is no logical reason

80
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,671
why disbelief should be considered such a horrendous crime.

81
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:48,432
Even if Islam were true

82
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:52,387
the fact that the Qur'an spends so much time condemning disbelievers

83
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:54,840
to the most obscene eternal torture

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,803
it only serves to emphasize that it is not.
