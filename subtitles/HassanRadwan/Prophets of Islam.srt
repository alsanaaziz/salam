1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:02,962
Here's a list of the prophets

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:07,991
that God sent to mankind according to Islam.

3
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:15,821
Now, here's a map of where all these prophets were sent.

4
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,598
Can you notice anything?

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,920
Far be it for me to tell God how to do His job,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,300
but couldn't He've spread those prophets around a bit more?

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,480
Maybe a couple to Norway or Tanzania,

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,287
a few to China or Canada

9
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:32,645
or the odd one or two to Australia or India.

10
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,810
As for when these Prophets were sent

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,468
most of them were sent over two thousand years ago.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,690
Again, I don't want to suggest that God is sleeping on the job, but

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,470
we haven't had any prophets for quite a long time now, and

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,120
let's face it, there are far more people around today

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,967
and far more who don't believe in the True Religion.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,900
Now let's have a look at the divine books that God has sent to guide mankind.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,190
Can you guess,

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,930
which area of the world God sent them?

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,084
You got it:

20
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:04,830
The Middle East!

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,762
Boy, God really loves the Middle East, doesn't He?

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,310
The Qur'an does say that there were other prophets sent.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,565
There's the Hadith that says there were

24
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:18,250
124.000 prophets sent!

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,402
But it seems we only know the names of those who came

26
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:24,941
from the Middle East.

27
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,444
I was told that

28
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,980
Buddha, Ram and Krishna

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,040
were originally Prophets of Islam,

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,226
but their true teachings were corrupted.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,620
Well, yes, if you mean by corrupted, if you mean

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,699
completely obliterated and

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,695
replaced with something that is the very antitheses of everything that Islam stands for.

34
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:50,059
Then, yes, you could say that they have been corrupted.

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,153
But let's assume that Buddha, Ram and Krishna really were Prophets of Islam.

36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,010
And that there were indeed 124.000 prophets sent to mankind

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,820
by God.

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,290
But their teachings were completely lost or corrupted.

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,377
Then I have to ask:

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,480
What was the point?

41
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,112
What was the point of sending messengers

42
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:16,180
if their messages had been totally lost?

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,730
What was the point if people who received their message

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,730
have neither record nor recollection of their message?

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,301
According to Islam

46
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,341
the Old Testament and the Gospels have also been corrupted.

47
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,980
Only the Qur'an remains pure and uncorrupted.

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,965
That's because God Himself is protecting the Qur'an.

49
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,392
How do I know that?

50
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,965
Well, uh, because the Qur'an says so!

51
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,450
Hmm, hang on a minute.

52
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,171
Isn't that a bit like saying:

53
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,790
It's true, because it says it's true.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,168
And if God did protect the Qur'an,

55
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:56,068
then why didn't He protect all the other books?

56
00:02:56,532 --> 00:03:01,162
Doesn't God want us to get the true, uncorrupted message?

57
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,811
Or does He want it to be a bit confusing for us?

58
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,361
Does He want it to be a bit of a puzzle?

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,687
Some sort of a game?

60
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:14,590
With God as the compère in a glittery suit.

61
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,350
Telling us we must choose the correct door,

62
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,703
one leading to the joys of eternal salvation and the other

63
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:24,149
the agony of eternal damnation.

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,136
Although of course, for most people

65
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:30,050
there is no choice.

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,800
Because most human beings remain

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,864
in the religion of their birth.

68
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,699
If you asked them they'll tell you:

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,770
“It really was most fortunate, because it also just happens to be

70
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,958
the True Religion.”

71
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,210
What a stroke of luck!
