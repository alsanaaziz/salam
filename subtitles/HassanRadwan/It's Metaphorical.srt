00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,341
I'm sometimes told that my criticisms of Islam are from a literalist perspective,

2
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,983
that my problem is not with Islam itself,

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:12,013
but with the literalists and fundamentalists such as the salafis.

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,509
Many of my Muslim friends argue,

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,563
that the Qur'an is not meant to be read in a literal and simplistic way.

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:21,356
They say that the passages about hell are metaphorical

7
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,150
or the verses about jihad are symbolic.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,857
Allah is using human language to convey a deeper, spiritual meaning that cannot be conveyed in a simple way.

9
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:35,529
I understand where these people are coming from, since I myself used to say similar things.

10
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,130
But ultimately I found this argument had too many holes in it.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,324
For a start, most Muslims do take the Qur'an literally.

12
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:49,364
So if God's aim is to convey this deeper, metaphorical meaning, then he's quite clearly failed.

13
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:54,193
In reply to this I've been told “well, that's the failing of people, not God.”

14
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:57,869
But if the message is flying over the head of most of mankind,

15
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,882
then either the message is too difficult for most human beings,

16
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:04,849
or human beings are not intelligent enough.

17
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,844
In both cases it is the author of the message or the creator of the human being who is at fault.

18
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:15,391
Then there are some who'll use the elitist argument,

19
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:20,541
that the deeper, metaphorical meaning is only for those of higher understanding and knowledge,

20
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:26,144
while the superficial and literal meaning is for the general, ignorant rabble.

21
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:29,307
Personally I find this argument offensive.

22
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:33,480
But perhaps the true message of the Qur'an really is only for those

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,030
select few human beings with a higher or mystical understanding.

24
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,273
I'm sure it makes those who hold such beliefs feel very superior to everyone.

25
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,548
But that leaves an image of a God

26
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:48,791
who doesn't really care about the vast majority of ordinary human beings.

27
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:54,589
Or perhaps he has a special stupid-people's-heaven waiting for them.

28
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,533
Another problem with the metaphorical argument

29
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:02,076
is that it is extremely difficult to read many of these violent and cruel passages

30
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:07,123
in any other way other than at face value.

31
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:12,597
What deeper meaning can one give to the graphic descriptions of torture and hell,

32
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,337
that does not involve unbearable suffering and pain

33
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:20,245
for what appears to be simply believing the wrong thing.

34
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:27,382
Or how can one give slaying idolaters a symbolic meaning that doesn't end up being contrived.

35
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:32,637
One example I heard recently was that the word “wife” in verse 34 of Suratu-Nisa –

36
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:36,118
where God gives permission for a husband to hit his rebellious wife –

37
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:39,001
really doesn't mean one's literal wife,

38
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:44,101
but actually means one's personal creativity.

39
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:48,734
Of course there is a far simpler and more obvious possibility.

40
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:53,033
Namely that the Qur'an really does mean what it appears to mean.

41
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,657
That the verses about hell, fighting infidels or hitting one's wife

42
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:02,636
really are as harsh and as cruel as they appear to be.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,239
And that the author of the Qur'an is not a divine being but a human being.

44
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:12,345
A human being from a harsh 7th century environment,

45
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:19,637
where no one had a problem with a literal belief in hell, slaying idolaters or hitting one's wife.

46
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:23,176
If there is a God and he is indeed just and merciful,

47
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:27,445
then he certainly cannot blame anyone for arriving at that conclusion.
