Hi God!

00:00:01.46,00:00:02.46
I'm a Muslim,

00:00:02.62,00:00:05.99
and I'm having a bit of a crisis of faith at the moment.

00:00:06.25,00:00:10.93
What with all the fanatics and the terrorists killing and slaughtering in Your name?

00:00:11.03,00:00:12.79
Not to mention things like Hell.

00:00:12.89,00:00:13.84
Slavery.

00:00:13.94,00:00:14.90
Concubines.

00:00:15.00,00:00:16.63
Allowing the hitting of wives.

00:00:16.73,00:00:18.96
And death for those who leave Islam.

00:00:19.33,00:00:20.52
So I was wondering

00:00:20.62,00:00:22.85
if You could help me regain my faith.

00:00:23.50,00:00:28.22
All these things are making me wonder whether the Qur'an really is Your literal word.

00:00:28.39,00:00:29.90
Maybe I've made a mistake.

00:00:30.00,00:00:33.34
Maybe Islam is not the real religion of God.

00:00:33.63,00:00:35.87
If You wouldn't mind helping me out here and

00:00:35.97,00:00:37.91
show me a sign or a miracle

00:00:38.01,00:00:40.79
that would prove that Islam is true,

00:00:40.89,00:00:43.57
and the Qur'an really is Your word.

00:00:43.74,00:00:49.00
Something really big that would leave me and the rest of humanity in no doubt.

00:00:49.25,00:00:50.33
How about

00:00:50.48,00:00:55.32
revealing the Qur'an in all languages to every single human being?

00:00:56.05,00:00:59.23
- Hmm, weell I could do that.

00:00:59.33,00:01:02.14
Ooor I could do something else like

00:01:02.24,00:01:03.82
a praying treeee!

00:01:03.92,00:01:08.82
Look! It's a tree and it's praying. Isn't it great?!

00:01:10.09,00:01:11.60
- Errhm.

00:01:11.82,00:01:13.29
Well, God.

00:01:13.39,00:01:17.03
To be absolutely honest, I think it's a bit naff actually.

00:01:17.26,00:01:20.76
What about making a billion trees pray

00:01:20.86,00:01:22.58
in every single country

00:01:22.68,00:01:25.25
all over the world, so that everyone can see it

00:01:25.35,00:01:27.76
and nobody is in any doubt?

00:01:27.86,00:01:30.58
I mean, You know, that would really

00:01:30.85,00:01:31.93
prove it!

00:01:32.51,00:01:38.22
- Nooo, I think just one in a forest in Australia is absolutely fine!

00:01:38.32,00:01:39.40
Look,

00:01:39.50,00:01:41.28
if that's not enough,

00:01:41.49,00:01:44.81
how about a fish with Allah written on it?

00:01:45.02,00:01:49.68
Look! Can you see it? It's a fish! And it's got Allaaah written on it!

00:01:50.20,00:01:52.91
- Nice, but errm

00:01:53.03,00:01:57.71
again, You know, I'm sure You can do better than that, God. I really do.

00:01:57.81,00:02:02.03
What about making all the fish all over the world

00:02:02.14,00:02:04.67
spell the words:

00:02:04.77,00:02:07.30
“The Qur'an is really God's word.

00:02:07.40,00:02:08.62
Really!”

00:02:09.16,00:02:12.26
In every single language all over the world.

00:02:12.37,00:02:18.71
- Nooo, no no, I think the odd fish in a remote part of the world is absolutely fine!

00:02:18.82,00:02:20.29
But I'll tell you what.

00:02:20.43,00:02:25.80
I'll send you a cloud formation that spells Muhammad during the Milad-un-Nabi celebrations.

00:02:25.90,00:02:29.10
The celebrations of the Prophets birthday.

00:02:29.95,00:02:34.37
- Mhhrmm yeaah, I can see that it's, erhm

00:02:34.47,00:02:36.35
it's a little bit

00:02:36.45,00:02:39.21
unclear to be honest with You.

00:02:39.51,00:02:41.51
What about

00:02:41.61,00:02:44.51
having clouds all over the world

00:02:44.61,00:02:45.95
where everyone can see them.

00:02:46.05,00:02:47.24
Spelling out:

00:02:47.34,00:02:54.18
“Islam is really the true religion and if you don't believe it you will be roasted in Hell.”

00:02:54.86,00:02:59.65
- Nooo, noo, I think one cloud to a gathering of Muslims is absolutely fine,

00:02:59.75,00:03:02.27
but here's another miracle for you.

00:03:02.37,00:03:04.14
It's a praying rock!

00:03:04.24,00:03:06.94
Look at that! A rock! Praying!

00:03:07.04,00:03:08.46
Can you believe it!?

00:03:08.86,00:03:10.37
- Erhm, hrm.

00:03:10.60,00:03:13.81
Yeah, well, urh. Ya, I can see that. It's a kind of a rock.

00:03:13.98,00:03:17.93
With a kind of, You know, a hole in the middle of it.

00:03:19.02,00:03:22.61
Why don't You make millions of rocks pray?

00:03:22.71,00:03:25.53
And make them stand up and

00:03:25.63,00:03:27.61
shout out “Allahu Akbar!”

00:03:27.71,00:03:30.92
I mean, You can do that, can't You? I mean, You're God, You can do anything.

00:03:31.02,00:03:33.11
- Of course, I can do that!

00:03:33.21,00:03:37.31
But I much prefer to have just one rock praying. Thank you very much!

00:03:37.41,00:03:38.44
Look,

00:03:38.54,00:03:41.18
I'm getting a bit pissed off with your bolshy attitude!

00:03:41.28,00:03:45.55
Either you believe in me or you don't, and if you don't you go to Hell!

00:03:45.65,00:03:47.09
- Well, that's the problem.

00:03:47.19,00:03:51.31
If my belief is so crucial to my salvation, why make it so confusing?

00:03:51.41,00:03:53.53
Why not make it absolutely clear?

00:03:53.63,00:03:55.90
Can You blame people for being confused?

00:03:56.85,00:04:00.42
And are You really going to torture them for all eternity?

00:04:00.52,00:04:05.49
Simply because they failed to be sure about Islam?

00:04:05.71,00:04:07.49
Is that fair, God?

00:04:07.73,00:04:13.60
- No, it's not fair!! But I'm bloody well God! And I can do what I fucking well like!

00:04:14.71,00:04:16.47
- True, God.

00:04:16.88,00:04:23.54
But I have to decide, whether I believe in such a cruel, sadistic, vindictive and,

00:04:24.04,00:04:26.29
quite frankly, vain God.

00:04:27.34,00:04:29.57
And quite frankly, I can't.

00:04:29.67,00:04:34.34
So I'm leaving Islam. Good bye!
