1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,312
Many Muslims claim that God revealed scientific facts in the Qur'an,

2
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:07,246
long before modern science discovered them.

3
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:08,837
Here are the main ones.

4
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:14,852
1. The Qur'an describes the fertilization process and embryonic growth before it was known about.

5
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:20,386
This is false. The writings of Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen and others

6
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:23,418
described these things long before the Qur'an

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,200
and the Qur'an is simply drawing on knowledge that was prevalent at the time.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,708
In fact it appears to repeat not only the accuracies of Greek ideas, but their inaccuracies also.

9
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:39,675
The Qur'an says:
[Arabic recitation]

10
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:42,670
“We created Man from a drop of mingled fluid...” (76:2)

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,417
This sounds very much like the germinal fluid that Hippocrates spoke of

12
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:49,918
when writing about male and female reproductive fluids.

13
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:55,957
The Qur'an also says:
[Arabic recitation]

14
00:00:56,057 --> 00:01:01,048
“(Man) is created from a drop emitted. Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs:” (86:6-7)

15
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,756
This description reflects the view of Hippocrates, common in the 5th century,

16
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,652
that semen comes from all the fluids of the body and

17
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,622
passes through the kidneys on the way to the penis.

18
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:14,100
We now know that it comes from the testicles.

19
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:18,279
It is also worth noting that the Qur'an always mentions the semen,

20
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:23,036
but nowhere does it mention the female egg or the actual process of fertilization

21
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:29,322
which one would expect to be in any basic description — if it was known about by the author.

22
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,487
The Qur'an also says:
[Arabic recitation]

23
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:42,215
[Arabic recitation]

24
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:46,245
“Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood;

25
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:49,437
then of that clot We made a lump;

26
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:52,826
then we made out of that lump bones

27
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:56,808
and clothed the bones with flesh;...” (23:14)

28
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,739
This account follows the four stages described by Galen

29
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,079
—writing around 500 years before Muhammad—

30
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,355
and includes his belief that bones were formed before the flesh.

31
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:14,668
2. The Qur'an describes Iron as being sent down from the heavens before it was known,

32
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,267
that meteors containing Iron fell to the earth from outer space.

33
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:24,183
[Arabic recitation]

34
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:29,766
“And We sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind,...” (57:25)

35
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,193
Again this claim is false.

36
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:36,052
It was common knowledge that meteors containing iron fell to earth from space.

37
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:40,391
The Ancient Egyptian word for iron was “metal of heaven”

38
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,905
and the Babylonians had a similar word.

39
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:47,595
In fact cultures as far-flung as Tibet and the Aboriginies of Australia

40
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:52,285
were all well aware that meteors fell to earth containing iron.

41
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:56,143
Actually all elements on Earth came from outer space.

42
00:02:56,243 --> 00:03:02,897
By singling out Iron the Qur'an only appears to reveal its ignorance of this fact.

43
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,937
3. The Qur'an describes the moon's light as reflected light long before it was known.

44
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:14,175
[Arabic recitation]

45
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:19,697
“And (He) made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a Lamp?” (71:16)

46
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,023
[Arabic recitation]

47
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:28,756
“And (He) placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light.” (25:61)

48
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:35,460
The claim is that the words Nur and Muneer mean reflected light.

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,345
This is quite simply wrong.

50
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:44,927
Nur means light and is used many times to refer to God Himself and so obviously cannot mean reflected light,

51
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:51,287
and Muneer means to shed light and for example verse 46 of Suratu Ahzaab (33:46)

52
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:55,663
makes this very clear when it says “Siraajan Muneera”

53
00:03:55,763 --> 00:04:01,296
using the very word that it said was only for the sun (siraaj),

54
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:04,352
and then it says muneera, spreading light.

55
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,110
But even if we were to accept the meaning they give,

56
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,031
it was already known that the moon's light was reflected light

57
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:18,809
and 1000 years before Muhammad, Aristotle described a lunar eclipse that makes this very clear.

58
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:25,021
4. The Qur'an mentions that salt water and fresh water don't mix before this was known.

59
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:36,423
[Arabic recitation]

60
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,714
“It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water:

61
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:43,128
One palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter;

62
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:49,402
yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed.” (25:53)

63
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:54,049
Once again there are other meanings that could be applied to this verse.

64
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,349
However, if we accept the meaning given, it was already known about anyway.

65
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,997
And 1000 years before Muhammad, Aristotle wrote:

66
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:08,408
“The drinkable, sweet water, then, is light and is all of it drawn up:

67
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,623
the salt water is heavy and remains behind,” (Meteorology Book 2 Chapter 2)

68
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:17,096
5. The Qur'an reveals the Big Bang before it was known.

69
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:29,423
[Arabic recitation]

70
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:33,256
“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were one piece,

71
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:35,709
before we clove them asunder,

72
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:40,158
and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe?” (21:30)

73
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:44,669
If this is supposed to be a description of the Big Bang then it is a terrible one.

74
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:47,677
The Big Bang is not about a lump blowing up.

75
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:51,411
Matter did not exist to be “cloven asunder”.

76
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:54,960
And there was certainly no splitting of Earth from Heaven.

77
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,979
The Earth formed 9 billion years after the Big Bang

78
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,541
in some tiny outpost of a vast universe.

79
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:08,014
One can hardly think of a more inaccurate description of the Big Bang, than this verse.

80
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:12,131
It does, however, follow very precisely creation mythologies

81
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,409
that were believed in at the time of Muhammad.

82
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,478
According to the Sumerians, “the heavens had been separated from the earth...”

83
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,139
and the idea that the heavens and the earth were one “single block”

84
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:26,551
that was “broken in two” was common in Ancient Egypt.

85
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:32,172
6. The Qur'an reveals that Everything comes from Water before this was known.

86
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:37,002
This is the verse that I've just quoted. And once again, it is false.

87
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:41,897
It was already known about. Aristotle records that Thales  believed

88
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:45,138
“that it [the nature of things] is water”

89
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,304
and Anaximander stated that “life came from the sea.”

90
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,370
7. The Qur'an revealed that planets move in orbits before this was known.

91
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,225
[Arabic recitation]

92
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:03,516
“It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon:

93
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:06,978
all swim along, each in its rounded course.” (21:33)

94
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,097
This verse clearly reflects the view, current in Muhammad's day,

95
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,499
that the sun, moon and planets all move around the earth.

96
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,737
There is absolutely nothing in this verse that suggests anything else.

97
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,854
8. The Qur'an reveals an expanding universe before this was known.

98
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:27,427
[Arabic recitation]

99
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,396
“We have built the heaven with might,

100
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:34,032
and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof)” (51:47)

101
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,546
Firstly this verse is not talking about the Universe, it's talking about the sky.

102
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:42,353
And secondly it makes no sense to suggest it means God is expanding the universe

103
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:46,963
after the verse has just said God has built the sky (past tense),

104
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:52,608
since the universe was already expanding 9 billion years before the sky was formed.

105
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:59,153
9. The Qur'an reveals the gaseous state of the universe pre Big Bang before this was known.

106
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:02,542
[Arabic recitation]

107
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,611
“Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke,...” (41:11)

108
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:10,257
Firstly gas and smoke are not the same thing. Gas is a state of matter.

109
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:16,124
Smoke is a collection of solids, liquids and gases that are emitted when a material combusts.

110
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:21,573
Secondly if one looks at the verses before and after this verse one can see very clearly

111
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:25,443
that it cannot have anything to do with the gaseous state of the universe.

112
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:31,273
It says God created the Earth, then he created the hills on the Earth,

113
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:35,562
and then it says he turned to the heavens when they were smoke.

114
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,665
10. The Qur'an mentioned the 7 layers of atmosphere before this was known.

115
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:45,484
“It is He Who created everything on the earth for you and then directed His attention up to heaven

116
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:50,230
and arranged it into seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things.” (2:29)

117
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:54,482
First of all modern science usually specifies 5 layers, not 7.

118
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:58,981
But more importantly the Qur'an is clearly not talking about the atmosphere

119
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:05,464
but about the heavens where the moon, sun, planets and stars are, because it also says:

120
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:09,470
“We have adorned the lower heaven with the beauty of the stars.” (37:6)

121
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:16,471
And also “... (He) made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a lamp?” (71:15-16)

122
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:20,550
One hardly needs to be point out that the stars, sun and moon

123
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,494
are nowhere near the Earth's atmosphere.

124
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:30,263
The Qur'an is clearly talking about the pre-Copernican view of the universe that regarded the earth as it's centre

125
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:36,005
with the 7 heavens containing the sun, moon, planets and stars around it.

126
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:40,887
These are some of the main claims of Scientific Miracles in the Qur'an, but there are others.

127
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:45,214
In fact Muslims are discovering new ones all the time. It's not hard to do.

128
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:50,451
Just open the Qur'an, pick a word or sentence and see if you can apply it to something in modern science.

129
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,878
Don't worry if it's already been discovered or if the words don't fit.

130
00:09:53,978 --> 00:10:00,275
We don't have to let minor details such as facts and truth get in their way.
