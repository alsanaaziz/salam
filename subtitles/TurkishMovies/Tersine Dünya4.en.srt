1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,821
– Ali, my darling!

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:05,983
What’s the matter, didn’t you miss me at all?

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:09,638
– And did you miss me?
Did you even think about if I have something to eat and drink?

4
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:11,275
– Don’t talk nonsense.

5
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,240
Don’t get in a huff.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,949
Have you ever come to visit me even once?

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,527
– I’m afraid of police and prisons.
– Isn’t my mother here?

8
00:00:19,627 --> 00:00:22,643
– Haven’t you heard? When she left the hospital she went completely nuts.

9
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:26,348
We had to admit her to a mental hospital.
– Serves her right.

10
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:28,747
She’ll come to her senses.

11
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:33,847
– I think her condition is not...
– Okay, okay! We’ll take care of it tomorrow.

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,683
– First let’s satisfy our desires, no?

13
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,783
– Uhm no, there’s no food at home...
– Okay!

14
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:44,504
– I’ll arrange something.
– Okay.

15
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:49,185
So you didn’t miss me at all, huh?

16
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:52,285
In that case neither did I miss you!
