1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,015
- And on the 6th day God created man and woman to have dominion over the animals.

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,997
And on the 7th day God rested.

3
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:07,953
And on the 8th day God rested.

4
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:10,189
And on the 9th day God rested.

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,694
So He basically just rested,

6
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:15,107
and then drowned everyone and invented the rainbow, and then rested.

7
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:17,726
And that, Isaac, brings us pretty much up till now.

8
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:20,546
- Thanks, Dad. Wow! The Lord sounds smart!

9
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:25,052
- He is smart! Especially those first 6 days where He made everything, but also generally.

10
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:28,827
- Now run along and play on the grit.
- Great, bye!

11
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:30,824
[Thunder]

12
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:32,541
- Abraham!!

13
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,797
- Lord!

14
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,045
- Abraahaaam!!

15
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:38,796
Not interrupting, am I?

16
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,127
- No, no, perfect timing!

17
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:43,345
I was just telling my son about all wonderful ideas You had.

18
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,044
- Good! Because, Abraham, actually...

19
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:49,649
I've had another one!

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,407
- Another idea? An idea from the Lord?

21
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:53,705
Oh, please tell!

22
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,974
- Yes, yes I will and...

23
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:57,415
...okay, and...

24
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,450
...do tell Me if you think this is sort of, well,

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,513
out of order, you know.

26
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:03,613
- What?

27
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:04,728
- Right.

28
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:08,125
Well, My new idea is

29
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,926
human sacrifice!!!

30
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:14,753
[Thunder]

31
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:15,980
- What?

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,357
You know, hu·human sacrifice...

33
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:20,707
Err, I think you should kill someone.

34
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:23,459
And I was thinking you should kill...

35
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:24,802
Ivan!

36
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,113
[Thunder]

37
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:27,452
- Ivan?

38
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,585
- Ivan... I·I·Ivan, your son?

39
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,407
- Oh, Isaac!
- Isaac!

40
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,944
I'm so sorry, yes, Isaac, yes, Isaac.

41
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,514
I, I think you should kill, Isaac!

42
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,987
So what... wha·what do you think?

43
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,056
- Brilliant!
- Really?

44
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:46,583
- Oh yes, Lord! Another winner!

45
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:49,629
Ivan, russel up a pile! We're making a sacrifice!

46
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,593
- Ivan? I thought you said his name was...

47
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,352
- Oh, no! Ivan's a much better name, Lord. You were right.

48
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:57,968
Oh, I can't wait to see that look on his face!

49
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,133
- You're sure you're fine with this?

50
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,408
- Absolutely!

51
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:04,177
- You wouldn't say...
- I would say what, Lord?

52
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:08,623
- Well, you know, if you thought I was asking you to do something, you know, wrong?

53
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,836
- If I thought it was wrong? Like I know!

54
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:15,246
Like I have any chance of forming an independent basis of right and wrong

55
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,900
outside the instructions of some supervisory being.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,237
- No, Lord! I am Your bitch!

57
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:23,998
- Yeah, o·okay, but...
- Finished the pile, Dad!

58
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,816
- Hello, Ivan!

59
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,502
- Where's the sacrifice?

60
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:30,059
- Ooh, that's a good point. Where is it?

61
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,299
Any ideas, Lord?

62
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,221
- Errrm...

63
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,107
- Oh wait, I remember! It's there!

64
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,218
- What?
- Yes, Isaac... Ivan!

65
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,302
The Lord's new idea is that I should sacrifice you!

66
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,358
- Me? Brilliant!

67
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,419
- Yes, on the 5th He invented the birds and the fish

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,582
and today He's invented me murdering my son!

69
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,952
Another winner, Lord!

70
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,475
You're certainly not tinkering with an already perfect creation

71
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,984
like some giant, see-through George Lucas.

72
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,613
- Hop on!

73
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,182
- Errm...

74
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,463
- Here's a nice, stabby bit of flint, Dad!

75
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,143
- No, errm, hang on!

76
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:08,305
- Well then, Ivan! Right, brace yourself, lad!

77
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,415
- No, wait! Look, wa·wait!

78
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,019
- Yes, Lord?
- It...

79
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,638
It, it was a test!

80
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,295
- Oh, a test!

81
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:19,166
Oh, what another brilliant idea!

82
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,931
- He's so smart!

83
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,584
- Did we pass?
- Oh, you really passed, Abraham! Yes.

84
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,488
- Big tick!
- Great!

85
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:29,871
- Well, do let us know if You have any other brilliant ideas, Lord.

86
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,517
- Yes, I...

87
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:35,474
Ooh, actually, while you have that flint handy,

88
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:38,426
I did have another, erm, idea.

89
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:39,948
- Yes?
- Well...

90
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,977
What if you were to - say if this is weird - ...

91
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,447
...but what if you would cut off your son's...

92
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:49,490
...oh what's it called...I can't think of the name...

93
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,589
...the skin around the...

94
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,323
Oh, I'll get back to you.

95
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:55,171
- Okay!

96
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,702
- Can't wait!
