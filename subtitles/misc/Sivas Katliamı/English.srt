00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,946
rapidly-expanding fire claimed lives where it touched.

336
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:18,541
- Had we been able to bring a single fire engine to the hotel,

337
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:22,752
while the cars were burning, the inferno wouldn't have happened.

338
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:27,266
Well, were the firefighters willing? No, they were not.

339
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:33,131
> Finally, despairing of the firefighters, the survivors ran to the windows for dear life.

340
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:36,498
They jumped into the air shaft, which opened to the next building.

341
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:41,695
31 people were trying to overcome a metallic barrier to flee the inferno.

342
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:45,787
Yet a surprise awaited them in the next building.

343
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:50,867
They were emerging into the provincial centre of the [right-wing] Great Union Party.

344
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:57,066
- From windows people armed with sticks were trying

345
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:07,247
to smite the victims, while hurling heavy curses.

346
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:11,961
They told us to “go back, burn alive and die!”

347
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:16,560
- Soon a middle-aged, middle-height gentleman appeared on a balcony.

348
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,947
He ordered the stick-carrying attackers back into the building.

349
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:27,217
“From now on, I will protect you. Come!” he said.

350
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:30,454
> The victims had been burned, the survivors rescued.

351
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:33,961
Yet the attacker's primary target was inside,

352
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:37,984
isolated in his room, together with Lütfi Kaleli.

353
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:42,822
A 78-year-old Aziz Nesin described those fatal moments

354
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:47,041
on a TV programme, before the flames of Sivas went cold.

355
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:51,709
- We were prepared for certain death. We were ready.

356
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,196
Actually, Lütfi Kaleli said a few times: “We are dying!”

357
00:28:56,296 --> 00:29:00,380
I told him: “Yes, we are dying. There is no hope, no rescue.”

358
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,920
- Aziz squatted where he stood. He was exhausted.

359
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,618
Yet this brave man told me this:

360
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:13,522
“Dear Kaleli, help me to this bed.

361
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:18,523
Let us not give this mob a bad corpse.”

362
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:22,654
- This is what I was thinking: I was in such a condition,

363
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:26,885
I thought I didn't want to die in a fearful posture.

364
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,578
Yet that was impossible, since I was writhing.

365
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:33,702
I was writhing due to the smoke, I was fighting against it.

366
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:38,326
I didn't want to leave behind an undignified corpse at some corner.

367
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:45,168
Then Lütfi Kaleli said: “Maybe,” he said

368
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:48,027
“if we go to the window looking to the road,” he said.

369
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:51,716
“Quickly,” I said. It was dark, he was holding my hand while going there.

370
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:54,023
- I held Aziz's hand.

371
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:57,208
I opened the door and we found ourselves

372
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:00,393
in enormous heat and thick smoke, where

373
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:03,660
you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

374
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,617
> Night had fallen and firefighters had begun to put out the fire.

375
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:12,415
Lütfi Kaleli was crying for help at the window.

376
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:17,734
Those below soon heard his voice. They mistook him for a police chief.

377
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,834
The fire engine came closer, extended the ladder

378
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:23,934
and Aziz Nesin began to climb down.

379
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:29,475
- “Hey, that's Aziz Nesin!”
- “Yes, of course, it's Aziz Nesin!”

380
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:37,907
- I was very exhausted.

381
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:41,768
I climbed down the ladder with great difficulty, pausing and squatting.

382
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:44,377
Also, a firefighter was climbing up from below.

383
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:48,090
- At that moment I saw the following scene.

384
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,978
A bearded, 40-50 years old man wearing a tie

385
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:58,390
and glasses recognizes Aziz Nesin,

386
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,481
and he says: “Don't rescue him!”

387
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:03,880
> They recognized Aziz Nesin down there.

388
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,094
The prey they were after was about to come down.

389
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:10,129
Cafer Özçakmak —Refah Party and town council member—

390
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:12,237
stood right next to the staircase

391
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,821
and yelled: “The actual beast we must kill is here!”

392
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:19,034
The firefighter, who came to the rescue, hurled a curse and returned.

393
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:24,848
Aziz Nesin and Lütfi Kaleli were all alone, consigned to their fate.

394
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:28,633
Lynchlaw awaited them. Behind them was hell.

395
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:32,682
- Three or four firefighters

396
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:37,037
were waiting for Aziz Nesin like cats,

397
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:41,341
ready to pounce on their prey.

398
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,485
When I saw them, I shouted again: “Help!”

399
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:49,508
As there was no positive reply

400
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,509
coming from below,

401
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,496
the firefighter, who had come to our rescue,

402
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:58,456
grabbed Aziz's wrist and

403
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:03,784
tossed him like an empty sack.

404
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:18,481
- I fell to the ground, where they kicked and punched me.

405
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:22,003
My head started to bleed. Here, exactly.

406
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:25,332
Well, they dragged me all the way to the police car.

407
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:29,338
I got into the car. Even then, a man came

408
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:33,137
running to the police car and kept punching me.

409
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:37,125
- Blood was running from his forehead and his cheeks.

410
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:41,238
Again I cried for help and

411
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:46,052
a uniformed, high-ranking inspector

412
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:50,110
came to the car and rescued Aziz

413
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,685
from the clutches of the attackers.

414
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,847
> Aziz Nesin was brought to the hospital with a minibus which

415
00:32:57,947 --> 00:33:01,009
belonged to the police, whom he'd been avoiding all his life.

416
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:06,012
Unable to catch its prey, the angry crowd chose another target

417
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:09,673
to vent its half-spent rage: the governor's headquarters.

418
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:15,837
- Such a roar, such clamour and lots of stones.

419
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:21,621
3 assistants, the Chief of Police, the army officer,

420
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:26,563
my 2 bodyguards —they're downstairs— and my janitor.

421
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:31,618
Nobody else. Everybody has gone to his place.

422
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:35,279
On one hand phone calls are constantly coming from Ankara.

423
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,680
On the other hand I'm literally under siege.

424
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:42,030
There are only 30-40 steps between us.

425
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,862
Those men will come and lynch me.

426
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:49,541
They'll hoist an Islamic banner. It has no other outcome.

427
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:53,865
> At 8:40 pm the protestors were chanting “Resign Governor, resign!”

428
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,848
They smashed the windows and were pounding at the door.

429
00:33:56,948 --> 00:34:00,559
The Governor said to those present: “Our end has come.”

430
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:06,117
For a while he contemplated suicide, instead of being lynched.

431
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:10,848
- I never had a weapon in my life, but sth. had to be done.

432
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,613
As soon as those people would come through the door,

433
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:18,535
we wouldn't be able to fight them.

434
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:22,952
> When they abandoned all hope and contemplated suicide,

435
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:26,163
the army officer said that he had

436
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:29,548
a reserve team of 18 soldiers available.

437
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:33,453
- “I command them to come here, they must come firing.”

438
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:36,869
“I'm giving the order,” he said. “Do that,” I said.

439
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:41,828
A sergeant should lead them.

440
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:45,367
The gendarmerie was facing the building.

441
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:50,893
18 soldiers came shooting in front of the government building.

442
00:34:50,993 --> 00:34:56,673
They moved step by step, step by step...

443
00:34:57,285 --> 00:35:01,978
> 18 soldiers had rescued the Governor from being lynched.

444
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:06,148
Yet it was too late for the others.

445
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:11,018
When the army finally intervened, the name “Sivas”

446
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:16,358
would go down in history as the site of a massacre.

447
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,289
[Tick-Tock]

448
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,450
> When a night curfew was enforced and

449
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,239
the security forces seized control of Sivas,

450
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,900
36 dead bodies, 60 injured

451
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,889
and a tarnished, lifeless city remained.

452
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:41,912
The death toll would rise to 37 with Metin Altıok's death.

453
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:47,040
Among the dead were 2 protestors and 2 hotel employees.

454
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:51,339
When Ankara received word of the aftermath, they were shocked.

455
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,499
- After I arrived at Ankara,

456
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,196
my friends met me in Esenboğa, where I

457
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,869
heard news of this catastrophe for the first time.

458
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:02,787
He told me that there had been a fire and

459
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,411
valuable people had died burning, suffocating.

460
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:08,157
- Demirel wasn't in Ankara at that time.

461
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:11,403
He was attending a manoeuvre or

462
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,925
exercise of the Turkish Armed Forces.

463
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,945
We talked on the phone.

464
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,743
After he heard about the incident,

465
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:22,367
he was obviously very shocked.

466
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,474
The first thing he told me was...

467
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:27,775
“Did you hear about the incident in Sivas?” I asked.

468
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,603
“Disaster, disaster!” he began to speak.

469
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,744
- Of course, I was deeply saddened.

470
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:35,575
I felt pangs of remorse

471
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:38,456
for failing to prevent such

472
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:41,826
an incident as a government official.

473
00:36:41,926 --> 00:36:46,751
I thought about resigning, but I guess it wouldn't have had any benefits.

474
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:53,188
- This is what Mr. Erdal İnönü once claimed:

475
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:58,181
“The soldiers were summoned, but they didn't intervene.”

476
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,856
He didn't really accept it.

477
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:04,453
And an argument like this: “10000 people were there.

478
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:08,600
Had the army come, should they've shot at them? They couldn't,” he told me.

479
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,529
Because in that case a much worse incident would've happened.

480
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,802
- Had they intervened in time, I think this wouldn't have happened.

481
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:20,745
I do not know whether they had planned to set the hotel on fire.

482
00:37:20,845 --> 00:37:23,905
Such things generally happen spontaneously.

483
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,637
This incident shouldn't have come to that point.

484
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:31,040
I think the government forces were weak in this regard.

485
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,096
But where or whom this weakness stemmed from,

486
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,796
I cannot know.

487
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,136
- You know the Kahramanmaraş Massacre happened,

488
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,612
this one always brings that one to mind.

489
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:46,258
It was investigated whether this incident

490
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,469
in Sivas was also a religious conflict.

491
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,910
He arrived at the opposite conclusion.

492
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,002
He also told me: “I investigated this. It wasn't like that.”

493
00:37:55,102 --> 00:37:57,578
I asked, “is it similar to Kahramanmaraş?”

494
00:37:57,678 --> 00:38:00,880
“No, it isn't. It's not like that,” he said.

495
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,216
What he feared the most was a religious conflict.

496
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,327
Sunnis against Alevis, Alevis against Sunnis.

497
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:10,358
> As for those who survived the hell of Madımak,

498
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:14,001
they heard what happened to those who remained in the hotel,

499
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:17,479
at night at the police station or the hospital

500
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,913
from the TV news. They were horrified.

501
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:27,325
- “The Madımak Hotel began to burn during the incident

502
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:30,109
According to the first reports

37 people died and 60 people were injured during the fire.”

504
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:37,930
- We turned on the TV, it was 9:45 pm. I'll never forget that time.

505
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,109
The news of Behçet Sefa Aysan's death,

506
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:48,662
that there was an incident in Sivas and that he died...

507
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:52,588
I couldn't believe it.

508
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:58,487
I actually didn't know that one of his names was Sefa.

509
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:04,715
I kept saying: “No, this is another Behçet,”

510
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:08,739
but sadly, it was true.

511
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:12,828
To relate that night is very hard for me.

512
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:16,328
It was the most horrible night of my life.

513
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:19,683
> The real gruesome scene was in the hospital.

514
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:23,200
Those who were burnt or poisoned by black smoke,

515
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,003
finished their day, which they had started with dances,

516
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:32,883
as corpses lined up side by side in a cold morgue.

> The picture of Metin Altıok depicted the atrocity

520
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,436
of Sivas perhaps better than a thousand words.

521
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:54,515
A few days later the Sivas victims

522
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:58,698
would be transported to the airport with dumper trucks.

523
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:03,763
- We really didn't want to leave

524
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:08,767
the dead and the injured behind.

525
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:14,462
We didn't want to leave without them.

526
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:20,016
We wanted to return all together.

527
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:26,484
Because in that moment they were closer to us than all the living.

528
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:30,800
Leaving them behind like that,

529
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,966
was like leaving behind an integral part

530
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,800
of our dignity, our honour and our humanity.

> The next day Deputy Prime Minister Erdal İnönü visited

533
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:52,174
Sivas, which resembled an earthquake-damaged city.

534
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:57,342
He visited the ruined Madımak Hotel and the injured, who were unrecognisable.

535
00:40:57,442 --> 00:41:01,146
On 6 July, the funeral for the dead

536
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:03,912
turned into a massive protest.

537
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:07,513
Erdal İnönü and the government were called to resign.

538
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:11,071
The Governor, the Mayor and the Chief of Police were dismissed.

539
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:15,690
The trial, which started in October 1993 with 124 defendants,

540
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:20,735
after being interrupted several times ended in July 2001.

541
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:24,945
31 defendants were sentenced to death.

542
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:28,342
The military staff launched an examination, with the result:

543
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,538
the garrison commander didn't commit any offence.

As for the Mayor Temel Karamollaoğlu,

545
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:41,159
