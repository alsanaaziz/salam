[Applause]

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,051
– Okay, this time on MythBusters

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:08,633
we’re testing like the biggest myth ever!

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,633
– That cat tastes like chicken?

5
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,530
– No! Does God exist?!

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,088
– Oh...! So you didn’t want me to put Tittles in the deep fryer?

7
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,513
– No...

8
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,689
– Excuse me.

9
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,384
– Now a lot of people may believe that God exists,

10
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,080
but how do we actually prove that God exists?

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,838
– Well the proof, that most people say, is that

12
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,724
they pray to God and he answers their prayer.

13
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:34,186
– Right, like when you pray for someone who’s really sick to get better.

14
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:37,100
– But that sick person may be getting better due to modern medicine,

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,849
the skill of a surgeon or just through the body’s natural healing.

16
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,283
– Exactly! God could be claiming credit for stuff that he has nothing to do with!

17
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:47,089
– So for this experiment to work we need a proper control.

18
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,993
– And that means kidnapping a terminally ill patient.

19
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,885
– I agree Dr. Adam.
– Why, thank you Dr. Jamie.

20
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:56,189
– Let’s go!

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,887
– Jamie, go! Go, go, go...!

22
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:02,227
Don’t make it so loud!

23
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,961
– I do the best I can.

24
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:07,867
– Julie’s body is just, like, riddled with cancer.

25
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,423
Until a few hours ago she was receiving all of the

26
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:12,661
benefits of western medicine in a hospital.

27
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,956
– Where am I?

28
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,248
– We stole her body,

29
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:16,776
cut off all her treatments

30
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,542
and now we’re about to pray to God to cure her.

31
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:23,090
– Sshh! You’re part of an experiment.

32
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,935
– Dear Lord Jesus... I love you a lot...

33
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,742
[Day 3]

34
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,889
– ... my own Mom and Dad...

35
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:35,360
[Day 5]
– I just love you God and Lord

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,751
and Jesus and Christmas. Thank you!

37
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,110
– Well, it’s been 5 days now, and it’s not looking good.

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,808
– No, it isn’t. I think she’ll be dead within the hour.

39
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,015
– God! God has really dropped the ball on this one!

40
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,690
– He has! In addition to praying for Julie’s recovery

41
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,365
I’d also prayed to God that Jessica Alba would ask me out on a date.

42
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,154
So far, she has not called.

43
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,569
[Electrical signal for cardiac arrest]

44
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,879
– So, do we call this myth busted?

45
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,492
– Well, the prayer didn’t work,

46
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:14,423
but that could be, because God couldn’t be bothered to save Julie.

47
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,930
– Right, because she could, like, go on to be really evil

48
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,316
like Hitler and kill millions of people.

49
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,909
– Yet, God allowed Hitler to exist.

50
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,005
– So you’re saying that God may exist, but

51
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:26,488
he just doesn’t give a shit about what happens in the world?

52
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,575
– It would explain a lot my friend!

53
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:32,316
– Interesting. Either way, I’m calling this myth busted!

54
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,277
– Agreed.
– Well, that was a real hoot!

55
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,521
Next week on the show we’re gonna look at the myth of Allah.

56
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:40,668
– Err, no. No, we’re not.

57
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,366
– What?
– No, no. Allah is real, totally real!

58
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:48,266
– Get Adam! He’s the infidel!
