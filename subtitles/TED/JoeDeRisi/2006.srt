1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,120
How is it; how can we investigate

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,316
this flora of viruses that surround us

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,931
and aid medicine?

4
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:24,126
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology

5
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:28,089
into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:29,836
I want to turn everything we know

7
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:33,667
right now, about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there,

8
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,083
into, let's say, a small chip.

9
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:41,184
When we started thinking about this project, how we'd make a single diagnostic assay

10
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,210
to screen for all pathogens simultaneously.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,313
Well, there are some problems with this idea.

12
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,413
First of all,

13
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:50,208
viruses are pretty complex

14
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,529
but they're also

15
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,007
evolving very fast.

16
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:56,259
This is a picornavirus. Picornaviruses:

17
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,336
these are things that include the common cold and polio.

18
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,133
Things like this. You're looking at the outside shell of the virus

19
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:06,623
and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very, very fast,

20
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:09,058
and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.

21
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:12,647
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,

22
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:15,809
usually it's this fast evolving-problem that's an issue,

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,271
'cause how can we detect things if they're always changing?

24
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,067
But evolution is a balance.

25
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:24,153
Where you have fast change you also have ultra-conservation.

26
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:26,357
Things that almost never change.

27
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,804
And so we looked into this a little more carefully.

28
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,356
I'm gonna show you data now.

29
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:33,217
This is just some stuff you can do on a computer from a desktop.

30
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:37,678
We took a bunch of these small picornaviruses, like the common cold, like polio and so on.

31
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:41,425
And I just broke them down into small segments, and so

32
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:44,243
took this first example which is called Coxsackie virus

33
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,001
and just break it into small windows.

34
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:50,617
And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares

35
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:54,101
an identical sequence in its genome to that virus.

36
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,395
These sequences right up here –

37
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,459
which don't even code for protein by the way –

38
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,781
are almost absolutely identical across all of these.

39
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,872
So I could use this sequence

40
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:07,155
as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,

41
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:09,675
without having to make something individual.

42
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:13,722
Now, over here this great diversity; that's where things are evolving fast.

43
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,574
Down here you can see slower evolution – less diversity.

44
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,419
Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say,

45
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,402
acute bee paralysis virus –

46
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,414
probably a bad one to have if you're a bee.

47
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:25,109
(Laughter)

48
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,180
This virus shares almost no similarity to Coxsackie virus,

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,105
but I can guarentee you that the sequences

50
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:35,679
that are most conserved among these viruses on the right hand on the screen,

51
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,257
are in identical regions right up here.

52
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:42,264
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation through evolution –

53
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:45,409
how these viruses evolved, by just choosing

54
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:51,724
DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.

55
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,935
Okay, so that's what we did, but how we gonna do that?

56
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:58,071
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school, I've been messing around making

57
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,010
DNA chips; that is printing DNA on glass and that's what you see here.

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,174
These little salt spots are just DNA tacked on a glass,

59
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:09,612
and so I can put thousands of these on a glass chip and use them as a detection reagent.

60
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:13,935
We took our chip over to Hewlett Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots.

61
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:19,348
And this is what you see. You can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.

62
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:22,387
So what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass.

63
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:26,410
Little flat things, and these are gonna be markers for pathogens.

64
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:30,130
Okay, I make little robots in labs to make these chips

65
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,961
and I'm really big on disseminating technology.

66
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:37,130
If you've got enough money to buy just a (?) array, you can build one of these, too.

67
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,963
And so we put a deep how-to guide on the web, totally free.

68
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,371
With, basically, order-off-the-shelf parts,

69
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:46,378
you can build a DNA array machine in your garage.

70
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:49,719
Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop-switch.

71
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,466
(Laughter)

72
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,625
Every important machine gotta have a big, red button.

73
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:58,325
But really, it's pretty robust. You can actually be making DNA chips

74
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:01,877
in your garage and decoding some genetic program pretty rapidly.

75
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,223
It's a lot of fun!

76
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,323
(Laughter)

77
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,843
And so, what we did –

78
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:10,378
and this is really a cool project – we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.

79
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:11,478
I talked about that.

80
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,726
You know the situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed?

81
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:19,461
Well, we just put, basically, all the human respiratory viruses on one chip.

82
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,623
And we threw in herpes virus for good measure. I mean, why not?

83
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,364
First thing you do as a scientist is gonna make sure that stuff works.

84
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,539
And so what we did is just take tissue culture cells

85
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,760
and infected them with various viruses.

86
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,482
And we take this stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,

87
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:37,026
the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells –

88
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,405
mostly viral stuff.

89
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:40,756
And stick it on the array to see where it sticks.

90
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,893
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they stick together. And so,

91
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:47,510
we can look at spots and if spots light up we know there's a certain virus in there.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,622
That's what one of these chips really looks like and these red spots are in fact signal coming from the virus.

93
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:56,564
And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus.

94
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,968
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm gonna just encode things as a little barcode,

95
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,878
grouped by family so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.

96
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:08,647
What we did is, we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus

97
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:12,589
and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.

98
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:18,117
And likewise we infected with parainfluenza 3, that's a paramyxovirus – you see a little barcode here.

99
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:23,624
Now, we did respiratory syncytial virus. That's the scourge of day-care centers everywhere. It's like (?).

100
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,402
(Laughter)

101
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,919
You can see that this barcode

102
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,957
is the same family, but it's distinct from parainfluenza 3, which gives you a very bad cold.

103
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:36,469
And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.

104
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,192
Polio and rhino, they're in the same family very close to each other.

105
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,558
Rhino is the common cold. We all know what polio is.

106
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,257
And you can see that these signatures are distinct.

107
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:47,137
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus

108
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,789
gives a nice signature down here.

109
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,516
And so, it is not any one stripe or something that tells I have a virus of a particular type here.

110
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:57,389
It's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.

111
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:01,623
Alright, I can see a rhinovirus and here is the blow-up of the rhinovirus – little barcode.

112
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:05,034
But what about different rhinoviruses? How do I know which rhinovirus I have?

113
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:07,963
There's a 102 known variants of the common cold,

114
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:10,840
and there's only 102, 'cause people got bored collecting them.

115
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,700
There are new one's every year.

116
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,538
And so, here are 4 different rhinoviruses and you can see, even with your eye –

117
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:20,848
without any fancy computer pattern matching recognition software algorithms –

118
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:24,321
that you can distuingish each one of these barcodes from each other.

119
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:25,817
Now this is kind of a cheap shot,

120
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,832
because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is.

121
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:32,346
And I, in fact, designed a chip, expressly to be able to tell them apart.

122
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:35,511
But what about rhinoviruses that never seen a genetic sequencer.

123
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:38,830
We don't know what the sequence is. Just pull them out to the field.

124
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,913
So, here are 4 rhinoviruses which we never knew anything about.

125
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,663
Noone's ever sequenced them, and you can also see

126
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:48,708
that you get unique and distinguishable patterns. You can imagine building up some library,

127
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,140
where there are real or virtual fingerprints of essentially every virus.

128
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,858
But that's, again, shooting fish in the barrel, you know, right?

129
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,644
You have tissue culture cells, there's a ton of virus. What about real people?

130
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,316
You can't control real people, as you probably know.

131
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:05,197
You have no idea what someone's gonna cough into a cup.

132
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,255
(Laughter)

133
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,632
And it's probably really complex, right?

134
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:13,171
It could be a (?) bacteria it could be a (?) virus, (?) certainly as host genetic material.

135
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:18,154
So how do we deal with this? And how do we do the positive control here? Well, it's pretty simple.

136
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:22,123
That's me getting a nasal lavage and the idea is,

137
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,172
let's experimentally knock people with a virus.

138
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:28,193
So, we – this is all RIV-approved by the way,

139
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,080
(Laughter)

140
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,092
they got paid – and basically experimentally knock people with the common cold virus,

141
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:38,037
or even better, let's just take people right out of the emergency room.

142
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:41,325
Undefined, community-acquired respiratory track infections.

143
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,627
You have no idea what walks in through the door.

144
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:46,401
So let's start off with the positive control first,

145
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:50,823
where we know the person was healthy; they got a shot of virus up the nose. Let's see what happens.

146
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,898
Day zero: nothing happening.

147
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:56,709
They're healthy and clean. It's amazing. Actually, we thought the nasal track might be full of viruses

148
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,243
even when you're walking around healthy; you're pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.

149
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:03,972
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern

150
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:07,993
and it's very similar to what we get in the lab during our tissue culture experiment.

151
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,343
So that's great! But again, cheap shot, right?

152
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:13,127
We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose, so

153
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,227
(Laughter)

154
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,714
we wanted it to work, I mean, he really had a cold.

155
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,286
So, err
(Laughter)

156
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:20,878
how about the people who're walking off the street?

157
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,691
So, here are two individuals represented by their (?) ID codes.

158
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,010
They both have rhinoviruses, so we've never seen this pattern in lab.

159
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,901
We sequenced part of their viruses.

160
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,798
Their new rhinoviruses noone's ever actually even seen.

161
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,994
Remember our evolutionary conserved sequences we're using on this array,

162
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:38,816
allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterised viruses.

163
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,125
Because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.

164
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,297
Here's another guy.

165
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,489
You can play the diagnosis game yourself here. These different blocks represent the different viruses

166
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,411
in this paramyxovirus family. So you can kinda go down the blocks and see what it signals, you know.

167
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,524
Doesn't have Canine Distemper, that's probably good.

168
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,158
(Laughter)

169
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:02,638
But by the time you get to block nine you see that respiratory syncytial virus. Maybe they have kids?

170
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:06,851
And then you can see also the family member that's related, RSV B showing up here.

171
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:12,214
So that's great. Here's another individual. Sampled on two separate days; repeat visits to the clinic.

172
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:15,007
This individual has parainfluenza 1

173
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:20,003
and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus. That's mouse parainfluenza.

174
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:22,551
The genetic relationships are very close there.

175
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,090
That's a lot of fun. So we built up the chip.

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,706
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.

177
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,293
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.

178
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:36,834
Everything that we keep getting out of (?), that is the National Repository of Sequence.

179
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,277
Now, we're using this chip and what are we using it for?

180
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:42,785
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this, you need a little bit more informatics.

181
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:47,849
So we designed a system to do automatic diagnosis. And the idea is, we simply have virtual

182
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,470
patterns, 'cause we never gonna get samples of every virus. That would be virtually impossible.

183
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,974
But we can get virtual patterns

184
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,183
and compare them to our observed result,

185
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:56,828
which is a very complex mixture,

186
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:02,617
and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.

187
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,012
And this is what this looks like.

188
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:08,323
If, for example, you used a cell culture that's chronically infected with papilloma,

189
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,399
you get a little computer readout here,

190
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,638
and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.

191
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,924
And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with.

192
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,909
So let's do something a little bit harder.

193
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,600
We put the beeper in the clinic. When somebody shows up

194
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,072
and the hospital doesn't know what to do, because they can't diagnose it, they call us.

195
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,273
That's the idea. And we set this up in the Bay Area.

196
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,723
And so, this case report happens 3 weeks ago.

197
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:36,288
We have a 28-year-old, healthy woman. No travel history. (?), doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.

198
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,248
Ten day history of fevers,

199
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:42,094
night sweats, bloody sputum, she's coughing up bood, muscle pain.

200
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:44,046
She went to the clinic and they gave her

201
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,299
anti-biotics.

202
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,519
Right? And then sent her home. She came back after ten days of fever.

203
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:54,286
Right? Still has that fever and she's hypoxic. She doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.

204
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:57,019
They did a CT scan. A normal lung

205
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,923
is all sort of dark and black here. All this white stuff, it's not good.

206
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:04,107
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's information.

207
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,927
There's likely to be infection. Okay.

208
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:13,315
So the patient was treated then with a third-generation ceftriaxone anti-biotic and doxycycline.

209
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:17,355
And on day 3: it didn't help. She progressed to acute failure.

210
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:20,056
They had to inter(?) her, so they put a tube down her throat

211
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:23,992
and they began to mechanically ventilate her. She could no longer breath for herself.

212
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:30,254
What to do next? Don't know. Switch anti-biotics. So they switched to another anti-biotic: Tamiflu.

213
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:33,499
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu, but they switched to Tamiflu.

214
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,664
And on day 6: they basically threw in the towel.

215
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,790
You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.

216
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,549
There's an 8% mortality rate, we're just doing this procedure.

217
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,093
And so basically – and what did they learn from it? You're looking at her open lung biopsy.

218
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,405
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.

219
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:55,934
All you can tell is, there is a lot of swelling, bronchiolitis. It was unrevealing, that's the pathologist's report.

220
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:59,650
And so, what did they test her for? They have their own tests, of course.

221
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,632
And so they tested her for over 70 different assays for every sort of bacteria and fungus

222
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:09,749
and viroassay you could buy off the shelf: SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV.

223
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:14,644
All of these. Everything came back negative. Over $100.000 worth of tests.

224
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:19,159
They went to the (?) for this woman. And basically, on hospital day 8:

225
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,297
that's when they called us. They gave us endo(?).

226
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:25,318
You know, little fluid from the throat, from this tube they got down there.

227
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,848
And they gave us this, we put it on the chip.

228
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:31,684
What did we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza 4.

229
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,901
What the hell is parainfluenza 4?

230
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:37,242
Noone tests for parainfluenza 4. Noone cares about it. In fact,

231
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:40,669
it's not even really sequenced that much. It's just a little bit of it sequenced.

232
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,305
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.

233
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:48,412
Noone would even consider it. Because noone had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.

234
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:50,604
And why is that? Just lore!

235
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,823
There's no data. No data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.

236
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:58,502
Clearly we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.

237
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:03,271
Okay. That's one case report. I'm gonna tell you one last thing in the last two minutes,

238
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,714
that's unpublished. It's gonna come out tomorrow.

239
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:11,535
And it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door.

240
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,277
Prostate cancer.

241
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:17,554
I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it.

242
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:20,344
Third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.

243
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:21,860
Lot's of risk factors,

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,583
but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.

245
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,512
From maybe about 10% of prostate cancer

246
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:34,726
there are folks that are predisposed to it. And the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this

247
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:38,916
early onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL. What is that?

248
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,706
It's an antiviral defense enzyme.

249
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:45,655
So we're sitting around thinking: why would men who have a mutation,

250
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:49,945
a defect in an antiviral defense system, get prostate cancer?

251
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,142
It doesn't make sense.

252
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,546
Unless maybe there's a virus.

253
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,646
So,

254
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:58,419
we put tumors – and now we have over a hundred tumors –

255
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,696
on our array and we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.

256
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,373
And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,

257
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:08,546
and I'm showing you it for a block of retroviral (?).

258
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,095
And what I'm telling you here from the signal is,

259
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:16,405
that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme and who have a tumor,

260
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:22,578
often have, 40% of the time, a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.

261
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:24,554
Okay, that's pretty wild.

262
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:27,685
What is it? So, we clone the whole virus.

263
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:32,938
First of all, I'll tell you, our automatic prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus.

264
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:36,017
But that doesn't tell us too much. So we actually cloned the whole thing.

265
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:38,248
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here;

266
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:42,196
it's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new. Noone's ever seen it before.

267
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:46,338
It's closest relative is in fact from mice, and so we would call this

268
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:52,102
a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting species other than mice.

269
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:56,781
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses.

270
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,189
And then we've done it for many patients now,

271
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,589
and we can say that they're all independent infections.

272
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,142
They all have the same virus, but they're different enough

273
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:07,270
that there's reason to believe that they had been independently acquired.

274
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,292
Is it really in the tissue? We end up with this. Yes.

275
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,213
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue

276
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,631
and used material to actually locate the virus,

277
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:19,112
and we find cells here with viral particles in them.

278
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:23,428
These guys really do have this virus. Does this virus cause prostate cancer?

279
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:26,994
Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.

280
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,472
Is it a link to ontogenesis? I don't know.

281
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:33,044
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?

282
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,632
Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.

283
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:39,584
But now it's a door. We have a strong association between the presence of this virus

284
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:42,699
and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.

285
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,881
That's where we're at. So,

286
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:48,370
it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid.

287
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,368
But that's what, you know, science is really good at.

288
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:53,419
This is all done by folks in the lab, I cannot take credit for most of this.

289
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,993
This is a collaboration of myself and Don.

290
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:59,421
And this is the guy who started the project in my lab, and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.

291
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:00,660
Thank you very much!
