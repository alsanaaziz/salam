1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,683
Lately, it's been tough for us Christians.

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:06,978
From Elton John to best-selling books, one of which calls God a delusion.

3
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,188
Faith is under attack!

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:13,076
Well, I have news for atheists. They're the ones who are deluded.

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,929
Because God exists. He made the universe.

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,135
I'm a 100% sure of it.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,693
How do I know? From the Bible!

8
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:23,937
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

9
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:28,819
It says so right there on page 1 of the book, God himself says he wrote.

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,137
Checkmate!

11
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:32,437
Sorry, atheists!

12
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:35,482
Scientists believe that the earth is billions of years old,

13
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,463
because of something called radioactive decay.

14
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:42,137
Well, the truth is the earth is only about 6000 years old.

15
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:44,420
God says so in the Bible.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,121
Now, who should we believe?

17
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:51,326
The creator of the universe or scientist freaks that don't even believe in God?

18
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:54,605
Astronomers claim they can see galaxies that are so far away

19
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,972
their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible.

20
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,396
But the Bible proves that's impossible.

21
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:03,196
When God created everything, He must have set the light

22
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,996
from those galaxies already beaming toward the earth.

23
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:10,414
So that, when He later gave us telescopes, we'd have more stuff to look at.

24
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,657
Haha! Is God unbelievable or what?!

25
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,757
Now, if you think that isn't the work of a conscious, omnipotent being,

26
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:19,787
whose son on earth was Jesus Christ,

27
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:22,831
then you must be deluded or something!

28
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,693
According to atheists, fossils in the ground show that

29
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:29,430
evolution, not intelligent design, produced all life on earth.

30
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:34,205
That's ridiculous! The Bible clearly says God created man in His own image.

31
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:37,655
Those dumb, deluded scientists also say you can see evolution happening

32
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:41,097
in the mutations of drug-resistant bacteria.

33
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:42,306
Give me a break!

34
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,995
God updated genes so more good Christians can go to heaven,

35
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,425
and that means we came from monkeys?

36
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,271
It's amazing how science can cure diseases,

37
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,123
smash the atom and create nuclear explosions,

38
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:57,426
yet be so wrong about everything that's mentioned in the Holy Bible.

39
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:02,226
I'm sure we'll find fossils of giants and unicorns one of these days.

40
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,505
Look, I'm a Christian.

41
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,933
And us Christians, we understand that things like miracles,

42
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,987
that defy the laws of physics, are the truth!

43
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,283
We will never question that, because we are 100% certain

44
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,686
God meant what He wrote.

45
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,842
Scientists aren't certain about anything.

46
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,321
All they have is a bunch of theories.

47
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:26,213
Clearly, stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives.

48
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,979
It's the 21st century.

49
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,262
We must live by the words of a very, very old religious book!

50
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:35,769
So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon,

51
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:39,207
we will physically ascend to Paradise!

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,339
And when I pray, the Creator Himself

53
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,382
and His son, born of a blessed virgin,

54
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,363
come and they speak to me,

55
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:50,462
and they tell me I am correct.

56
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,196
So, atheists!

57
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:57,296
Who exactly is the deluded one here?

58
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,000
Inspired by Sam Harris & Richard Dawkins.

59
