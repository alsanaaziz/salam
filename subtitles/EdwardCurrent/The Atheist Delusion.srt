1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,683
Lately, it's been tough for us Christians.

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:06,978
From Elton John to best-selling books, one of which calls God a delusion.

3
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,078
Faith is under attack!

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:13,076
Well, I have news for atheists. They're the one's who are deluded.

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,929
Because God exists. He made the universe.

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,029
I'm a 100% sure of it.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,649
How do I know? From the Bible!

8
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:23,798
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

9
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:28,819
It says so right there on page 1 of the book, God himself says he wrote.

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:29,983
Checkmate!

11
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,283
Sorry, atheists!

12
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:38,463
Scientists believe that the earth is billions of years old because of something called radioactive decay.

13
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:42,137
Well, the truth is the earth is only about 6000 years old.

14
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:44,337
God says so in the Bible.

15
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:46,047
Now, who should we believe?

16
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:51,112
The creator of the universe or scientist freaks that don't even believe in God?

17
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:54,605
Astronomers claim they can see galaxies that are so far away

18
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,972
their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible.

19
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,341
But the Bible proves that's impossible.

20
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:05,996
When God created everything, He must have set the light from those galaxies already beaming toward the earth.

21
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:10,366
So that, when He later gave us telescopes, we'd have more stuff to look at.

22
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,657
Haha! Is God unbelievable or what?!

23
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:19,689
Now, if you think that isn't the work of a conscious, omnipotent being whose son on earth was Jesus Christ,

24
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:22,628
then you must be deluded or something!

25
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,693
According to atheists, fossils in the ground show that

26
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:29,430
evolution, not intelligent design, produced all life on earth.

27
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:34,205
That's ridiculous! The Bible clearly says God created man in His own image.

28
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:41,097
Those dumb, deluded scientists also say you can see evolution happening in the mutations of drug-resistant bacteria.

29
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:42,310
Give me a break!

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,296
God updated genes so more good Christians can go to heaven, and that means we came from monkeys?

31
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:50,271
It's amazing how science can cure diseases,

32
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,123
smash the atom and create nuclear explosions,

33
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:57,426
yet be so wrong about everything that's mentioned in the Holy Bible.

34
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:02,226
I'm sure we'll find fossils of giants and unicorns one of these days.

35
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,415
Look, I'm a Christian.

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,714
And us Christians,

37
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:10,987
we understand that things like miracles, that defy the laws of physics, are the truth!

38
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:16,587
We will never question that, because we are 100% certain God meant what He wrote.

39
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,819
Scientists aren't certain about anything.

40
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,265
All they have is a bunch of theories.

41
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:26,142
Clearly, stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives.

42
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,979
It's the 21st century.

43
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,262
We must live by the words of a very, very old religious book!

44
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:35,769
So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon,

45
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:39,031
we will physically ascend to Paradise!

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,419
And when I pray, the Creator Himself and His son, born of a blessed virgin,

47
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,219
come and they speak to me,

48
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,388
and they tell me I am correct.

49
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,854
So, atheists!

50
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:57,296
Who exactly is the deluded one here?

51
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,000
Inspired by Sam Harris & Richard Dawkins.

52
