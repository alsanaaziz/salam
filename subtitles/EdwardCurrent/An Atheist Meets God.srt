1
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,891
I don’t believe in God...

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,580
Everything came from the Big Bang...

3
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,514
And the Bible was written by mortal men...

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:14,423
What the...? Oh, oh!

5
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,417
– Where am I?

6
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:24,934
– Where do you think you are?

7
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,281
– Who are you?

8
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:30,302
– I am the God of the Bible, the Creator of the universe.

9
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:33,418
You are here to be judged before Me!

10
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:34,733
– Am I in heaven?

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,385
– For the moment.

12
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:41,153
According to My allknowing knowledge, you did not believe in Me, when you were alive.

13
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,012
Explain why. I need to know.

14
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:48,458
– Errm, because... there was no evidence that you actually exist?

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,188
– No evidence?!

16
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:53,552
Did you ever hear of something called the Holy Bible??

17
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,192
– Well, yeaah, but...

18
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,566
– “Yeah but” nothing!

19
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,218
I wrote that book.

20
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:01,902
And if you had read it, you’d know that.

21
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:05,595
Do you actually admit that you were an atheist?

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,151
– Well, yeah.

23
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:13,580
– As I wrote in the Bible, the only way to salvation is through My son, Jesus Christ.

24
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,830
– But I was a good person...

25
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:19,579
I volunteered at a homeless shelter for like ten years.

26
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:25,582
– It doesn’t matter! Did you or did you not worship Me, the God of the Bible?

27
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,425
– Errrh, no...

28
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:32,393
– Wrong answer!! I created the universe, you should’ve worshiped and praised Me!

29
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,112
I’m not very happy about this!

30
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,675
– Isn’t that a little... petty of you?

31
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,864
– Silence!! My universe, My rules!

32
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:46,632
– Ookaaay, how about if I start worshiping and praising you now?

33
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:52,344
– Too late. You failed your test in life, and now you must face eternal consequences.

34
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:56,506
– Buut, I thought you were supposed to be all-merciful and all-forgiving...

35
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,488
– Only to people who believe that I exist.

36
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:03,003
Once I make someone die, a·and they see Me...

37
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,069
...they can’t change their mind!

38
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,199
Exactly how forgiving do you expect Me to be?

39
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,605
– Can you make an exception?

40
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:15,079
I mean, I taught my children to be considerate and generous to others.

41
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:16,572
– NOOooo!!

42
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:21,097
What do you think heaven would be like if I let in every good person??

43
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:22,422
– Errrhmm...

44
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:25,470
– I only want people who praised Me and worshiped Me,

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,552
and thanked Me when good things happened to them.

46
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:31,746
Preferably on national television.

47
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:35,261
– Sooo, why do you allow bad things to happen?

48
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:38,198
Even to Christians who love you.

49
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:41,169
– I don’t have time for this nonsense!!

50
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,653
I·I have prayers to listen to, and and

51
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:46,963
toasts to burn images of the Virgin Mary onto.

52
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:50,477
I mean, I could be blessing America right now!

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,411
You·you can pick up a copy of My frequently asked questions from My asistancy here on your way out.

54
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:57,836
– Where am I going?

55
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:00,169
– Where do you think you’re going?!

56
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,092
I hate to have to do this, but I am sending you to Hell!!

57
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,942
To burn in excruciating pain for eteernityyy!

58
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:11,325
– Bu·but whyy?? I·I wasn’t a bad person at all.

59
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:16,394
– You failed to believe in what I wrote about Myself in My best-selling book!

60
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:20,817
You might as well have been a baby raper! Your fate would’ve been the same.

61
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,229
– OK, I tell you what.

62
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,908
Let me return to earth for a day, so I can tell my loved ones that you really exist,

63
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,671
and that they must worship and praise you, or else.

64
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,108
– NOOooo!!

65
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,373
They must learn the truth the same way everyone else does.

66
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:39,672
Throough one of the many, questionably translated and edited versions

67
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:45,286
of My 2000-year-old collection of desert scribblings, an·and nothing more!

68
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,683
Besides, your skull was totally crushed by that bus.

69
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:53,914
Bringing you back to life would be medically impossible, even by miracle standards.

70
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,593
There are some things I just cannot fix.

71
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:00,141
Remember that Terri Schiavo chick?

72
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:04,764
There’s profound brain damage, amputated limbs, rabies...

73
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:06,002
– Buut I thought you were...

74
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,757
– Silence!! You had your chance!

75
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,798
Hell is what people like you get for being skeptical of Me!

76
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,080
Or for being born into a culture with the WRONG religion!

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,992
And failing to find the path to Jesus Christ instead!

78
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,730
– Can I speak to someone else, like whoever made you?

79
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,200
– Goodbye non-Christian!!!

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,764
– NOOOOoooOoooOooo!

81
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:35,049
Let this be a warning to the rest of you!

82
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,219
Worship and praise Me, the God of the Bible,

83
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,713
or else!

84
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:48,002
BROUGHT TO YOU BY CHRISTIANS FOR THE PRAISING AND WORSHIPPING OF THE GOD OF THE BIBLE, OR ELSE.
