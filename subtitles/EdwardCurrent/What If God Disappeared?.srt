1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,269
Many people don't believe in God.

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:08,723
But imagine for a moment what would happen if God just suddenly disappeared.

3
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:16,038
What if we woke up one morning and God had decided to make himself simply vanish from site?

4
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,040
What kind of world would that be like?

5
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,784
I know one thing. We Christians would be the first to know.

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,227
Because we can sense God's real presence within us.

7
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,197
If God disappeared,

8
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:33,278
we would instantly feel a huge void in our hearts.

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,652
We would be empty and hopeless and desperate inside.

10
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:40,364
Like atheists feel today.

11
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,515
If God disappeared,

12
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:50,415
missionaries in Africa and New Orleans would have no reason to help out victims of Malaria and AIDS and Hurricane Katrina.

13
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:54,151
Spreading the Gospel to the sick and poor would be pointless.

14
00:00:54,251 --> 00:01:00,764
Particularly if the missionaries couldn't personally benefit in the afterlife, for having done so.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,724
If God disappeared,

16
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:05,063
there'd be no reason to pray.

17
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:09,695
Success or failure in life would depend only on hard work and luck,

18
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,690
rather than on God's bestowing his Grace upon us, or

19
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:17,245
choosing not to for some mysterious reason.

20
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:23,689
Missing children might or might not be returned home safely, whether we pray for them or not.

21
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,675
And Thanksgiving would be just another dinner.

22
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:31,858
Although, there wouldn't be any food with no God there to provide it.

23
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,737
If God disappeared,

24
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,342
natural disasters would begin to strike at random.

25
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,149
They'd pay no regard to the religious beliefs of the people whose lives they destroy.

26
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:48,749
Imagine earth quakes and tsunamis striking without mercy or warning!

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,551
What a cruel and horrible world that would be.

28
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,454
If God disappeared,

29
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:58,730
the simple pleasures in life would be meaningless.

30
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:04,509
A baby's laugh, rather than bringing joy to one of God's beautiful creations,

31
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:10,788
would become a mere sound emitted by something, that would probably want food soon.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,095
A puppy, rather than being cute for the fluffy fur that God created to bring adorableness into our lives,

33
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:23,695
would be just an object, which we could have sex with if we wanted to.

34
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,535
If God disappeared,

35
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,767
society would break down immediately.

36
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:32,617
Since our legal system is based on the Christian values of the Bible,

37
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,304
as stated in the constitution,

38
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,251
all laws would instantly vanish from the books.

39
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,794
I know that I'd loose all sense of right and wrong.

40
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:47,842
I'd likely go on a blood-thirsty rampage of killing and cannibalism.

41
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:54,571
Because the fear of disobeying God is presently the only thing preventing me from doing that.

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,446
Actually, if God disappeared,

43
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:59,563
we would all suffocate to death.

44
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:04,172
As each breath we draw is a divine gift from our Lord.

45
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,150
In fact, everything that is good –

46
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,692
from breathing to a child's laugh,

47
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:16,281
to the God-fearing morals that prevent us from lustfully devouring each other's bloodied corpses –

48
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:17,863
would be gone,

49
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:22,090
if God disappeared...

50
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,519
Don't let God disappear.

51
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,630
Give to your local megachurch today.
