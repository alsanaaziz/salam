00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,771
Another video from me. This one is about

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:07,537
verse 34 of Suratu-Nisa, which

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,313
apparently gives permission to the husband to hit his wife.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,527
And the bit that concerns us is this bit:

5
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:20,130
[Arabic recitation]

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:26,112
So, “those women who you fear their rebellion.”

7
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:29,185
“Nushooz.” Now we'll talk about that in a minute.

8
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:30,798
“faAAithoohunna”

9
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:34,191
So the first step is “faAAithoohunna.”

10
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:36,759
Wa'ada means to

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:42,140
sermonize and to admonish and to talk to, you know,

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,540
to advise and warn.

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,298
Speak to them in other words.

14
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:52,100
Next: “...waohjuroohunna fee almadajiAAi...”

15
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,622
Next is, separate from them in their beds.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,280
So in other words a try of separation, if you like.

17
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:04,176
And finally, if those two steps don't work, the last one is:

18
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:06,102
“waidriboohunna”

19
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:08,404
“hit them”

20
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,655
Okay, that's the verse.

21
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:18,260
Let's start at the beginning. What is that they are supposed to have done? What is the rebellion?

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,508
The word ‘nushooz’

23
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:29,684
linguistically means something that protrudes or rises up or pokes out.

24
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:36,147
So in this context it is understood as the wife rising up against the husband,

25
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:39,702
rebelling, disobeying the husband.

26
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,654
But what actually constitutes disobedience?

27
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:47,322
Some scholars say it means

28
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:50,988
leaving the house without the permission of the husband.

29
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:58,883
Some scholars say it means preventing the husband from sexually enjoying her.

30
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:01,792
Others say

31
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:07,314
it means not beautifying herself for her husband.

32
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,644
Some use all of these.

33
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:15,209
More modern scholars try to make it appear to be more serious,

34
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:19,333
'cause they feel a little bit, I think, uncomfortable about the fact that

35
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,911
they seem relatively trivial,

36
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,144
in this day and age.

37
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:30,946
So they say it's something much more serious. It's going out with other men, liaising,

38
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,384
flirting with other men, though of course

39
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:41,777
it doesn't mean adultery as some actually seem to be suggesting, because

40
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,462
adultery is a quite separate crime in Islam,

41
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,264
which requires

42
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:53,701
being stoned to death or being lashed in some people's opinions.

43
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:58,886
So, okay, take your pick out of any of those.

44
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:01,572
What is rebellion...?

45
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,862
How do you deal with it?

46
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:09,591
Well, there are three steps in the verse, which I've just read.

47
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,908
The first is to talk to her.

48
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:16,686
If that doesn't work, then you try separation.

49
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,688
Both of these are fine at the moment.

50
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:23,438
They are things that obviously, you know, would occur to anyone.

51
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:29,622
And then the third step is to hit them.

52
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:34,224
The hadith explains that there should be “[Arabic quotation]”

53
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:37,974
It should be not harsh.

54
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:41,505
In other words it should be a light beating.

55
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:47,040
And the scholars explain that it's meaning it should not leave any bruises

56
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,031
and it should never be on the face.

57
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:56,892
Some scholars also specify that the hitting should be with a miswak.

58
00:03:56,992 --> 00:04:02,051
Now, a miswak is a tooth stick used in the Middle East and around

59
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:04,267
other parts of the Muslim world.

60
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,900
And here is an example of a tooth stick, there we are.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,250
You see that?

62
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,345
Okay, so basically, you know,

63
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:15,434
you gonna tap them on the shoulder there, not on the face.

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,256
No tapping on the face.

65
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,523
On the shoulder like that.

66
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:23,496
Some scholars say it should be with

67
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,696
a feather!

68
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,869
See I've got my visual aids. There you are, it's a feather.

69
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,019
And that should be there like that,

70
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,384
or like that, or like,

71
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:34,522
oh no, sorry not in my face! Just like that.

72
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:39,129
Or with a handkerchief, there we are.

73
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:41,962
“Don't do it again!”

74
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:44,391
Or like that...

75
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,235
You know,

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,663
actually none of these things

77
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,155
are specified as being the only things you can use.

78
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,239
In fact, you can use the hand, although

79
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,962
a lot of Muslim scholars these days try to

80
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,838
deny that's the case, but actually there's no

81
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:11,503
specific hadith or any injunction that says you can't use the hand.

82
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,798
There are some scholars who say “yes, you can hit them with your hand.”

83
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,670
And you can use any other means as well and there are even hadith which

84
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,642
prove that, so, those people who say that it's only with a miswak or feather

85
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:28,538
are being a bit economical with the truth,

86
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,209
shall I say.

87
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,365
I've also found it very strange because

88
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,456
many Muslim scholars also add

89
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:42,162
that “if you follow the example of the Prophet then you should never hit your wives,

90
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:46,966
because the Prophet never hit his wives and we are obliged to follow the example of the Prophet.”

91
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:52,304
“And the Prophet also said that ‘the best of you is the best to his wife.’”

92
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,655
And so they say, well, therefore, you know, in reality a good Muslim would never hit his wife.

93
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,856
Well, in that case then who is this verse for?

94
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,745
Is it for the bad Muslim?

95
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:11,414
'Cause he's the worst one to tell that you can hit your wife.

96
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,705
Anyway, let me move on.

97
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:23,722
Now, in the light of all these restrictions some Muslims say “well, it amounts to a virtual ban.”

98
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:26,370
“You should never really hit your wife.”

99
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:30,971
Then why have such a verse? Why not just ban it?

100
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,757
As for hitting somebody with a feather,

101
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:40,125
or handkerchief

102
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,465
or the trusty, old miswak.

103
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,106
It's just ridiculous!

104
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,308
The whole thing is just ridiculous.

105
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,059
I mean, try to picture it.

106
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,945
You talked to your wife.

107
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,205
You separated from her.

108
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,955
None of that has worked, eventually you say “right okay, darling,” -

109
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:06,827
you tried all those things -

110
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,423
“I want you to just stand still for a bit

111
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:11,630
to get my miswak,

112
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:16,514
just to tap you a few times on the shoulder, not on the face or anywhere where it's gonna hurt.

113
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:22,640
Just to tap you, there we go, 1, 2, 3, 4...” I'm not sure how many times “...5, 6, 7, that should actually do it.”

114
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,785
What she's supposed to do?

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,417
“Wow, yeah...”

116
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,638
“You know, when you talked to me, it didn't make any sense.

117
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:35,553
When we separated, I still didn't understand. But you know, now that you've tapped me on my shoulder,

118
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,154
it's all clear!”

119
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,489
It's ridiculous! It's absurd!

120
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,445
I can't think of any scenario,

121
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:46,789
that makes this, you know, any sense.

122
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,791
I have to give credit to the fundamentalists.

123
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,386
I mean, I don't agree with them, I think their view is abhorrent!

124
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:56,182
But! I have to say, they give it to you straight.

125
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,152
They, you know...

126
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:01,449
They don't mess about, they don't give you any

127
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,653
apologetic nonsense.

128
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:08,679
They say, you know, they stand up for what they believe and they say it.

129
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,006
Straight from the hip.

130
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,216
“Hit you” means “hit you.”

131
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:19,089
And you're allowed to hit your wife and that's it.

132
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:23,619
And it just doesn't make sense. I mean, for a long time I kept telling myself, well,

133
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,246
God knows that which I don't know.

134
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,083
There's something which I obviously don't understand with my

135
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,310
puny, human understanding, with my

136
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,678
limited

137
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,369
use of reason and logic.

138
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,790
But at the end of the day, that's what God gave me. That's all He gave me, you know.

139
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:45,230
And I'm supposed to make a decision

140
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,834
about what I believe from that. So,

141
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,503
what else can I do,

142
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,642
but use reason to judge?

143
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:59,133
And you must do the same as well.

144
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,792
Make up your own mind.

145
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,386
Good bye!

146
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,278
I'm an Ex-Muslim, but I'm not against Islam.

147
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,266
I defend the right of Muslims to practice their faith freely.

148
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:19,613
I'm against the anti-Islam movement that is on a mission to destroy Islam or expel it from the West.

149
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:24,578
I am against all types of bigots and xenophobes

150
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:29,087
including extreme right-wing nationalists such as the National Front, BNP

151
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:32,969
or Christian fundamentalists or Neocons in the USA.

152
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:39,678
All of whom I consider a much greater threat than Muslim extremists.

153
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:47,243
Having said that - I nevertheless reserve the right to criticize Islam if I wish.
