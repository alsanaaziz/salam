1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
The Qur’an says:

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,760
[Arabic recitation]
وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,350
“And I have not created the Jinn and man except so that they worship Me.”

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,880
And if you don’t worship Him, then God says:

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:24,358
[Arabic recitation]
فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ

6
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:30,038
“As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony

7
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:33,269
in this world and in the Hereafter;

8
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,698
nor will they have anyone to help them.”

9
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,301
When I read the descriptions of God in the Qur’an,

10
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,400
I can’t help thinking that He sounds like a very needy god.

11
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,680
A god who needs to be recognized,

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,292
praised and worshiped.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,358
He creates man with a free will.

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,130
Then demands he surrender that very free will

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,230
and submit completely to God’s will.

16
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,212
And if man does not worship, praise and glorify Him,

17
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,267
then He’ll roast his skin off.

18
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,367
Repeatedly.

19
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:07,838
The God of the Qur’an and the Bible

20
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:10,139
sounds suspiciously human

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,258
and not even a very good human

22
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,402
but a power-mad, brutal human,

23
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:15,727
a tyrant,

24
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,686
a Hitler with super-powers 

25
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,913
or a Saddam Hussein with weapons of divine destruction.

26
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:27,784
Many Muslims will tell me,
“What about His mercy, love and forgiveness?”

27
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,818
“What about Paradise?”

28
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:33,475
But these things are only for those who believe and worship Him.

29
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:35,562
Just like any human dictator.

30
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,181
He will reward highly those who are part of his little club

31
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:41,747
and obey his every command.

32
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:46,155
He will smile benignly and pat his faithful slave on the head,

33
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:50,302
while sadistically torturing all who refuse to submit.

34
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:54,200
I don’t think much of such mercy or love.

35
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,590
That’s a very easy type of love and mercy.

36
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,646
What makes God’s tyranny and brutality even worse,

37
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:06,473
is that unlike earthly brutal dictators,

38
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:09,900
who we can unfortunately see with our own eyes,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,079
we can’t see God.

40
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:16,321
We have to choose between one of the many competing religions

41
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,557
and ancient texts

42
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:21,804
that claim to be God’s True Message.

43
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:26,250
Yet despite the understandable doubts and reservations one would naturally have,

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,330
God will still burn anyone

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,073
who doesn’t choose the right religion.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,899
If there is a God

47
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,934
and if He has indeed given us a mind to think with

48
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,041
and reason to reason with,

49
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,543
then I cannot but come to the conclusion

50
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:45,359
that the description in Islam or any other religion

51
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,867
is simply not real.

52
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:51,180
They are man-made constructions.

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,929
They describe a god

54
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,835
with human needs and weaknesses.

55
00:02:55,935 --> 00:03:01,330
In fact, when compared to the best, wisest and most noble of mankind,

56
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,580
the God of Islam and the Abrahamic religions

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,568
is not even a very good human being.
