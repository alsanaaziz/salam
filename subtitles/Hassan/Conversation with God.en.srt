1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
Hi God!

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,525
I’m a Muslim,

3
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:06,102
and I’m having a bit of a crisis of faith at the moment.

4
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:10,888
What with all the fanatics and the terrorists killing and slaughtering in Your name?

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,700
Not to mention things like Hell.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Slavery.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,900
Concubines.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,625
Allowing the hitting of wives.

9
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,259
And death for those who leave Islam.

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,605
So I was wondering

11
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,587
if You could help me regain my faith.

12
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:28,327
All these things are making me wonder whether the Qur’an really is Your literal word.

13
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,900
Maybe I’ve made a mistake.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,530
Maybe Islam is not the real religion of God.

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,775
If You wouldn’t mind helping me out here and

16
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,029
show me a sign or a miracle

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,840
that would prove that Islam is true,

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,720
and the Qur’an really is Your word.

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,211
Something really big that would leave me and the rest of humanity in no doubt.

20
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,519
How about

21
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:56,080
revealing the Qur’an in all languages to every single human being?

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,363
– Hmm, weeell I could do that.

23
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:01,924
Ooor I could do something else like

24
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:04,071
a praying treeee!

25
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:09,671
Look! It’s a tree and it’s praying. Isn’t it great?!

26
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,676
– Errhm.

27
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,286
Well, God.

28
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:17,073
To be absolutely honest, I think it’s a bit naff actually.

29
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:20,790
What about making a billion trees pray

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,594
in every single country

31
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,289
all over the world, so that everyone can see it

32
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:27,968
and nobody is in any doubt?

33
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,740
I mean, You know, that would really

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,490
prove it!

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,345
– Nooo, I think just one in a forest in Australia is absolutely fine!

36
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:39,521
Look,

37
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,543
if that’s not enough,

38
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,143
how about a fish with Allah written on it?

39
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:50,130
Look! Can you see it? It’s a fish! And it’s got Allaaah written on it!

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,050
– Nice, but errm

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,827
again, You know, I’m sure You can do better than that, God. I really do.

42
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:01,777
What about making all the fish all over the world,

43
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,635
errhm, spell the words:

44
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,337
“The Qur’an is really God’s word.

45
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:09,250
Really!”

46
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,464
In every single language all over the world.

47
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:18,797
– Nooo, no no, I think the odd fish in a remote part of the world is absolutely fine!

48
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,470
But I’ll tell you what.

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,627
I’ll send you a cloud formation that spells Muhammad during the “Milad-un-Nabi” celebrations.

50
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:29,010
The celebrations of the Prophets birthday.

51
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:34,324
– Mhhrmm yeaah, I can see that it’s, erhm

52
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,369
it’s a little bit

53
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,287
unclear to be honest with You.

54
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,231
What about

55
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,995
having clouds all over the world

56
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,963
where everyone can see them.

57
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,318
Spelling out:

58
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:55,123
“Islam is really the true religion and if you don’t believe it you will be roasted in Hell.”

59
00:02:55,223 --> 00:03:00,110
– Nooo, noo, I think one cloud to a gathering of Muslims is absolutely fine,

60
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,364
but here’s another miracle for you.

61
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:04,160
It’s a praying rock!

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,995
Look at that! A rock! Praying!

63
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,815
Can you believe it!?

64
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,642
– Erhm, hrm.

65
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:14,397
Yeah, well, urh. Ya, I can see that. It’s a kind of a rock.

66
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:18,424
With a kind of, You know, a hole in the middle of it.

67
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,745
Why don’t You make millions of rocks pray?

68
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,509
And make them stand up and

69
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,817
shout out “Allahu Akbar!”

70
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,976
I mean, You can do that, can’t You? I mean, You’re God, You can do anything.

71
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,183
– Of course, I can do that!

72
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:37,428
But I much prefer to have just one rock praying. Thank you very much!

73
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:38,528
Look,

74
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,206
I’m getting a bit pissed off with your bolshy attitude!

75
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:45,604
Either you believe in me or you don’t, and if you don’t you go to Hell!

76
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,106
– Well, that’s the problem.

77
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:51,520
If my belief is so crucial to my salvation, why make it so confusing?

78
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,836
Why not make it absolutely clear?

79
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,980
Can You blame people for being confused?

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,061
And are You really going to torture them for all eternity?

81
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:05,878
Simply because they failed to be sure about Islam?

82
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,790
Is that fair, God?

83
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,620
– No, it’s not fair!! But I’m bloody well God! And I can do what I fucking well like!

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,896
– True, God.

85
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:24,121
But I have to decide, whether I believe in such a cruel, sadistic, vindictive and,

86
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,273
quite frankly, vain God.

87
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,836
And quite frankly, I can’t.

88
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,034
So I’m leaving Islam. Good bye!
