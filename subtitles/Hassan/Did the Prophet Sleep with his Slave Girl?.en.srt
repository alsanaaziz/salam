1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,051
Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu!

2
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:06,049
This is a quick response to somebody from the Council of Ex-Muslims

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,066
who asked about Surah At-Tahrim.

4
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,090
Chapter 66. Verses 1 to 5.

5
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:14,061
I’ll just read them.

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,016
“Oh, Prophet of God why have you forbidden that which God has made lawful for you,

7
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:21,036
seeking to please your wives?

8
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:23,070
But God is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.

9
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:26,060
God has ordained for you the dissolution of your oaths,

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,012
and God is your Protector.

11
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,049
He is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.

12
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:36,093
When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives and she then divulged it to another,

13
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,087
God made it known to him,

14
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,027
and he confirmed a part and repudiated a part.

15
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:44,068
Then when he told her, she said:

16
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,078
‘Who told you this?’

17
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,088
He said:

18
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:48,015
‘He told me,

19
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,044
Who knows and is well acquainted.’

20
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:52,067
If you both turn in repentance to Him,

21
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:54,099
your hearts are indeed so inclined,

22
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,021
but if you back up each other against him,

23
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:02,093
truly God is his protector, and Gabriel and every righteous Muslim who believes

24
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,027
and furthermore the angels will back him up.

25
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,034
It may be,

26
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,025
if he was to divorce you all,

27
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,070
that God would give him better wives than you

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,013
who submit, who believe, who are devout,

29
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:17,034
who turn to God in repentance, who worship, who travel, who fast—

30
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,050
previously married or virgins.”

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,050
Okay, so what is this referring to?

32
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,017
Basically, there are two reasons given.

33
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:29,007
One is that the Prophet was caught with Maria the Copt, the slave girl,

34
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:33,008
on Hafsa’s day; he was sleeping with Maria the Copt, his slave girl.

35
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:36,042
On Hafsa’s day; and Hafsa got very upset and

36
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:39,057
he told her not to tell anyone.

37
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:41,001
She went and told Aisha.

38
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,092
Aisha then said:

39
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,052
“this is not right” and they both nagged the Prophet, till the Prophet said:

40
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:49,002
“I make Maria haram for me. She’s haram.”

41
00:01:49,012 --> 00:01:50,096
Then these verses were revealed.

42
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:54,033
The second reason is that the Prophet used to go and drink honey

43
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,058
at Zaynab’s house.

44
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,005
And when he went to sleep with Hafsa,

45
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,003
Hafsa didn’t like the smell.

46
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:03,001
And so she told Aisha and Aisha said:

47
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:07,056
“Yea, let’s say that he’s been drinking maghafir, have you been drinking maghafir?”

48
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,085
’Cause that got a strong smell and then he’ll stop doing it.

49
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,096
And so they went and said:

50
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:17,026
“Oh, have you been drinking maghafir?” which is sweet and has a strong smell.

51
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:20,058
And he said: “No, but I’ve been drinking honey in Zaynab’s house.

52
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,037
But I will make it haram for myself. It’s haram, now.”

53
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:27,045
So take your pick, but what do the tafsirs say.

54
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,049
Okay.

55
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,059
Well,

56
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,033
basically,

57
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:34,007
most of the tafsirs give these reasons,

58
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,032
both of those reasons.

59
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:38,009
Some of them actually only give the first one about Maria the Copt.

60
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:44,071
That is the one that’s the most common and most famous amongst the mufassirin.

61
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,049
Certainly in the classical period!

62
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,092
Nowadays however, the reverse is true.

63
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,024
Nowadays, people prefer the one about the honey.

64
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,073
And in some cases you won’t even find

65
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,061
the explanation of Maria the Copt.

66
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:59,049
That’s been kind of obliterated

67
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:02,038
and in some places completely cut out. For example, if you look in the

68
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,072
tafsir of Ibn Kathir online.

69
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,092
Ibn Kathir spends two pages,

70
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:14,082
two pages are talking about the Coptic slave girl incident.

71
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,061
If you look at the tafsir online in English,

72
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,050
it’s not there.

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,082
All these two pages

74
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:21,052
gone, crossed out,

75
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,029
disappeared.

76
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,031
You decide for yourself why.

77
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:30,041
This is the tafsir of Tabari.

78
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,073
Tafsir Al-Imam Tabari.

79
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,092
And I’m reading from it and it says:

80
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:41,039
[Arabic quotation]

81
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,075
“The Prophet slept with”

82
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,039
“Mamluqatuhu”

83
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,093
“his slave girl”

84
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,059
“Mariah the Copt”

85
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:51,058
[Arabic quotation]

86
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:55,028
“in the house of his wife, Hafsa.”

87
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:58,081
[Arabic quotation]

88
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:02,004
If you’re not sure what I’m reading. Here it is:

89
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,018
[Arabic quotation]

90
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,040
“So Hafsa found him”

91
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,012
“in the middle of it.”

92
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,035
[Arabic quotation]

93
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,035
“And became jealous of that.”

94
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:14,083
[Arabic quotation]

95
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:17,019
“Would you be happy if I made her haram”

96
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,007
[Arabic quotation]

97
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,070
“and don’t come near her?”

98
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,052
“Yes,” she said.

99
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:23,042
[Arabic quotation]

100
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:25,085
So he made her haram for himself.

101
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:28,069
[Arabic quotation]

102
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,098
“Don’t tell anyone then.”

103
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,067
So that’s tafsir Tabari.

104
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:35,018
As I said, Tafsir Ibn Kathir.

105
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,096
Tafsir Ibn Kathir al-Mujallad ar-Rabi’.

106
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:47,010
The same thing, gives the same, similar Hadiths, gives other Hadiths, gives two full pages of it.

107
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:51,022
For example, he gives this one where he says:

108
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:54,086
[Arabic quotation]

109
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:57,039
“The Prophet (s.a.w) used to have

110
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,053
a slave girl which he used to have sex with.”

111
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:03,050
[Arabic quotation]

112
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,021
And so Hafsa and Aisha didn’t stop nagging him until he made her haram and then these verses were revealed.

113
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:11,018
That’s tafsir Ibn Kathir.

114
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,019
What other tafsirs have we got here?

115
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,032
This is tafsir Baydawi.

116
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,092
Okay.

117
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,097
Tafsir Baydawi, al-Baydawi.

118
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:33,034
[Arabic quotation]

119
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:37,032
So it is related that he slept with

120
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:40,023
[Arabic quotation]

121
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:44,005
there are two narrations where it is Aisha or Hafsa.

122
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,064
That was tafsir Baydawi.

123
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:50,080
This is tafsir Zamakshiri al-Kashaf.

124
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,031
Same thing. What have we got here?

125
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:59,034
The reason why I’m doing all this, because the guy on the Council said he couldn’t find any sources in the tafsirs.

126
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:04,012
So I’m just showing him that these are all the classical tafsirs and it’s all here.

127
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:08,097
In black and white, and if he can’t find it, then he needs to ask himself why.

128
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,003
Why is it that it’s disappeared?

129
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:15,062
[Arabic quotation]

130
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,003
Etc., so there we are.

131
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:21,009
But I’ll just show you one last tafsir, which is a very interesting one, because

132
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:27,030
it’s called Safwatu Tafasir and it’s basically a summary of all the classical tafsirs and

133
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,076
gives an overview.

134
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:32,067
This guy didn’t give his own opinion, he just collected all the classical tafsirs

135
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:35,056
and gave an overview of what they all say.

136
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:40,068
And so it gives a good impression of what was the general opinion of the tafsirs.

137
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,035
The two reasons he gives:

138
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:46,081
number one —as you can see it has more space there;

139
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:49,076
this is the second reason— smaller space.

140
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,076
The first one is Maria the Copt.

141
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:56,031
And it gives the reason that:

142
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:00,073
[Arabic quotation]

143
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,038
“he used to divide the days amongst his wives”

144
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,029
[Arabic quotation]

145
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,090
“when it was Hafsa’s day,”

146
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,092
[Arabic quotation]

147
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:10,098
“she asked for permission from Rasul Allah”

148
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,042
[Arabic quotation]

149
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,085
“to go and visit her parents.”

150
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,062
“So he allowed it.”

151
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:17,074
“So when she went out,”

152
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:20,054
[Arabic quotation]

153
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,064
“he sent for his slave girl”

154
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,047
“Maria the Copt.”

155
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,022
[Arabic quotation]

156
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,064
“And he slept with her”

157
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,096
[Arabic quotation]

158
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,048
“in Hafsa’s house.”

159
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,058
[Arabic quotation]

160
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:34,096
“So she came back”

161
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,060
[Arabic quotation]

162
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,022
“and found her in her house”

163
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,052
[Arabic quotation]

164
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,095
“and became very jealous”

165
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,003
[Arabic quotation]

166
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,089
“You brought her into my house while I was absent”

167
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,035
[Arabic quotation]

168
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:51,032
“and slept with her in my bed” and so on.

169
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,093
The second reason is the Shurb al-‘asal [the drinking of honey].

170
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:59,059
And what’s very interesting is that he gives the overall view of what all the tafsirs

171
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,039
and all the mufassirin said, and he said:

172
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,076
[Arabic quotation]

173
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,059
“The first one is the most

174
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,046
famous, the most known

175
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,013
[Arabic quotation]

176
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,036
and this is the best one,”

177
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,072
[Arabic quotation]

178
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,086
“the preferred one, the strongest one.”

179
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:18,044
And he says that it is the strongest one for many reasons.

180
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,010
Amongst the reasons he gives,

181
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,067
that for example:

182
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,094
“Forbidding a wife,

183
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:28,049
forbidding a woman upon oneself

184
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:32,051
to please other women is a stronger reason than forbidding honey.”

185
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:37,004
And that “the wording of the verse with its

186
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:40,096
very severe warnings and strong threats of

187
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,036
divorce and changing the women

188
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,082
for better women and that

189
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:48,072
God and the prophets, God and the angels and the pious Muslims

190
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:52,084
are all on the Prophet’s side to help him against these people conspiring against him.”

191
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:57,010
All point to something very serious.

192
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,002
And that there was some ‘tanafus’, some serious jealousy, competition

193
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:04,047
amongst the wives and some jealousy going on there.

194
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:10,048
And all this makes the first one more likely and the second one very weak.

195
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:13,061
And he even quotes Ibn Kathir who says:

196
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:16,080
[Arabic quotation]

197
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,030
that Ibn Kathir said that

198
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,056
“The case of drinking honey

199
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:26,063
as the reason for the revelation of these verses is questionable.”

200
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:29,007
Okay, it obviously is up to you which tafsir you prefer.

201
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:35,061
I think it’s interesting how many modern Muslims regard the story of Maria the Copt as being weak, fabricated or whatever.

202
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:38,017
And yet obviously, the great scholars of the past certainly didn’t think so.

203
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,094
They thought it was the best explanation.

204
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:46,033
I just wonder whether modern Muslims are being influenced by modern ideas of morality?

205
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,016
Okay, take care, bye bye!
