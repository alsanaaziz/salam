1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
I was born a Muslim.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,563
My father from Egypt

3
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:05,850
and my mother English.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,652
I didn’t take much interest in religion during my teens.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,600
But as I turned twenty in the year of 1979

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,680
a series of events led me to delve deeper into the religion of my birth.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,482
Amongst them was my trip to Egypt.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,590
There I had long discussions with my religious uncle.

9
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,130
One night he handed me the Qur’an and asked me to read it.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,423
I wasn’t very keen on reading it,

11
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:36,232
as I didn’t want to spend my holidays sat inside reading.

12
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:40,390
I decided I would read a little, then politely put it to one side.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,560
But to my surprise, I found I couldn’t put it down.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,350
The words seemed to be full of mystical meaning

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,490
and spiritual truths

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,240
and I found myself being very moved.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,740
I never saw the harsh and severe passages so often quoted these days.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,470
Not that they weren’t there,

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,234
but they never spoke to me.

20
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,642
At least not in a literal way.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,863
I returned to England full of zeal and determination

22
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:09,400
to devote myself to my newly rediscovered faith.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,311
I began to study Arabic and I completed

24
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,937
a BA in Arabic and Islamic studies

25
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:18,000
at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,284
I became president of the “Islamic Society,”

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,267
a post I held for three years,

28
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,595
and instituted daily as well as Friday prayers.

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,949
I also set up a Da’wah book store.

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,806
I later joined a Da’wah society in North London

31
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,835
and shared its Amirship.

32
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,110
I edited an Islamic magazine,

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,380
wrote four books for Muslim children

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,570
and spent fifteen years

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,370
as a school teacher at Islamia Primary School in London.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,990
For many years I was very devout and committed.

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,172
But by about the year 2000

38
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,487
doubt started creeping in.

39
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:58,164
It’s difficult for me to identify exactly why this took place.

40
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,688
There were certain events in my personal life and in the world around me,

41
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,267
that shook me out of my comfort zone

42
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,960
and caused me to reflect and think.

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,160
But it would be misleading to conclude that they were the reason I lost my faith.

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,262
Of course, I didn’t blame Muslims for the actions of extremists.

45
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:17,868
Nor did I blame Islam for bad life experiences.

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,830
But these things do naturally make one take stock.

47
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,936
There would be something wrong with you if they didn’t.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,094
I began to take a fresh look at Islam, this time much more critically.

49
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:35,110
I started asking questions I hadn’t dared ask in the past.

50
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,560
How could God justify burning unbelievers for all eternity?

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,030
What logic or reason makes this just and fair?

52
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,352
What evidence do I really have

53
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:47,670
that the Qur’an is the word of God?

54
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,024
At first I tried to suppress my doubts

55
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:52,738
and reacted with denial, anger and blame.

56
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,074
I denied there was any problem with Islam.

57
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,676
I grew angry at criticism and I’d blame the West for creating problems.

58
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,832
When I did eventually accept that there was something wrong,

59
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,984
I still couldn’t accept that Islam itself was to blame.

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,297
“It was the way Islam was being interpreted,” I told myself.

61
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,383
“That was the problem!”

62
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:18,088
So I started calling for reinterpretation and reform of traditional views,

63
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:22,511
but instead of easing my conscience, this only made me feel even more uneasy.

64
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:26,520
I felt I was simply trying to mould Islam to suit myself.

65
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,852
And it only served to undermine Islam’s claim

66
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:34,453
to be divine guidance for all times and all places.

67
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,369
Finally I told myself,

68
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,580
that although my rational mind found it difficult to believe in certain things,

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,410
there must be explanations beyond my capacity to understand

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,930
and that God knows best.

71
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,500
I should simply hear and obey, and hold fast to the rope of Allah.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
I felt I had nothing to gain

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,155
and everything to loose

74
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:56,957
by rejecting Islam.

75
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,103
So I forced myself to go through the motions of being a good Muslim

76
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:03,474
in the hope that my faith would return.

77
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:07,280
But this pretence only made me depressed and loose all motivation.

78
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,151
The problem is that one cannot choose to believe.

79
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,220
Either one does or does not, and if there is a God

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,058
then the last thing he would’ve wanted me to do

81
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,958
was to pretend to believe in something that I didn’t.

82
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,230
It was a huge relieve when I finally admitted to myself

83
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,850
that I didn’t believe in Islam.

84
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,925
Though this was only the start for another long, hard

85
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,000
road of dealing with the fear and guilt that one is left with.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,446
It is drummed into the heads of every Muslim

87
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:36,410
that rejecting Islam is the worst thing one can do.

88
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,240
It simply does not bear contemplating.

89
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,168
The concept of the Kafir is so abominable,

90
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:45,849
even now there are times when I think God is going to strike me down

91
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,519
with a bolt of lightning and burn me eternally in Hell.

92
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,426
Even when my rational mind tells me this is absurd,

93
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,270
I still think

94
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,330
that I must in some way be a bad or evil person for rejecting Islam.

95
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,943
But as more time passes

96
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:05,591
the more my rational mind is able to dispel these fears

97
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:09,722
and I’m able to feel stronger and more confident within myself.

98
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,168
The fact that I no longer believe in Islam doesn’t mean I’m against Islam.

99
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:16,217
I know that it brings a great deal of good to many people’s lives.

100
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,829
And of course, I know that the vast majority of Muslims are decent, kind and loving people

101
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,494
and I have a great deal of empathy for them.

102
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,736
Nor do I feel it is my duty to pass on my beliefs to others.

103
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:30,370
Something I felt I had to do when I was a Muslim.

104
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,900
If someone is happy being a Muslim or a Christian or whatever,

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,067
and is a peaceful person

106
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:40,069
then I will defend their right to practice their faith freely.

107
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:43,419
I simply reserve the right to air my own views

108
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,580
if I want, and criticize something if I want.

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,470
However, while I do not believe in telling anyone what they should believe

110
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,852
I do think that one should have the courage to examine the beliefs

111
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:57,854
that are essential to one’s life and guide one’s actions.

112
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,561
If one is truly satisfied with them,

113
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,097
then they should be fully embraced.

114
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,512
But if they do not stand up to close scrutiny

115
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,530
then they should be discarded.

116
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,111
Life is too short

117
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:14,680
to allow it to be dictated by beliefs that one does not truly believe.
