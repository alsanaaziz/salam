1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Although I no longer believe in Islam, I am, of course, aware

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,838
that there are many different interpretations.

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,832
There are moderate interpretations,

4
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:12,423
non-literal interpretations, Sufi interpretations

5
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:14,606
and modernist interpretations.

6
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:21,019
In fact, there are innumerable, personal interpretations that vary from Muslim to Muslim.

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,105
It has, however, become the fashion

8
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:24,861
for far-right nationalists,

9
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,878
Christian fundamentalists and other bigoted groups,

10
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:30,304
to insist that “true Islam”

11
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:34,258
is the Islam of the extremists and the fanatics and the terrorists,

12
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:37,363
and to equate Islam with fascism.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,992
They want to convince everyone, including Muslims themselves,

14
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:43,778
that moderate forms of Islam are wrong.

15
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,073
And that Muslims, who appear moderate, are either ignorant or practising taqiyya,

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,376
hiding their true intentions.

17
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:54,348
It's funny, but I rarely heard that word during all the years I was a Muslim.

18
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,345
Yet since reading the rants of these bigots, one would think it was a fundamental pillar of the faith.

19
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:01,342
The reason these extreme bigots do this,

20
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:04,791
is because they need to justify their war on Islam.

21
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,584
When they insist that Islam is a fascist ideology,

22
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,023
and that all true Muslims are Nazis,

23
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:15,489
they're trying to force people to agree that Islam must be destroyed and Muslims wiped out.

24
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,889
Sadly, they have already managed to convince some far-right racists,

25
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:23,285
who were just itching for an excuse to justify violence

26
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:26,385
against innocent Muslim immigrants.

27
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,534
However, these people are wrong.

28
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,664
“True Islam” is not the Islam of the extremists.

29
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:35,771
In fact, there is no such thing as “true Islam.”

30
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:38,473
Of course, every group within Islam

31
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:40,916
will claim that they follow “true Islam”

32
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:43,121
and that the other groups are wrong.

33
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:46,956
But the fact is that Islam is made up of many traditions.

34
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:50,307
Mystical traditions, as well as literalist.

35
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:53,790
Moderate traditions, as well as hard-line.

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,256
The claim that true Islam is the Islam of the terrorists or that it is a fascist ideology,

37
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:01,531
is not only completely false,

38
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:03,778
it is also a dangerous belief,

39
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:07,585
as it incites hatred towards ordinary Muslims.

40
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,637
I applaud the fact, that Maryam Namazie,

41
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:12,598
head of the Council of Ex-Muslims,

42
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,816
is at pains to make the distinction

43
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,829
between the Islam of the ordinary and peaceful Muslim

44
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,429
and the political Islam of the Islamists.

45
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,454
It is this harsh and brutal version of Islam,

46
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,999
that seeks to impose itself on the world,

47
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,973
that needs to be confronted.

48
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:33,079
Not the Islam of the vast majority of peaceful and moderate Muslims.

49
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:35,938
It is extremism that is the enemy,

50
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:39,119
and extremism can use many pretexts.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,375
It is true that Islam has a very long way to go before it can truly say,

52
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:48,022
that the extremists amongst them have been defeated ideologically.

53
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:51,379
But they certainly don't have a monopoly on extremists,

54
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,102
and sadly, there will always be a minority of human beings

55
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:59,157
who will use whatever religion or belief or political ideology

56
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:04,036
to carry out acts of violence and murder against innocent people.

57
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,649
I know some will argue that Islam is unique,

58
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:12,762
because it is particularly resistant to change and reinterpretation.

59
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:18,324
I agree that reinterpreting God's eternal word poses a unique difficulty for Muslims,

60
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,648
but it is certainly not impossible.

61
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:24,708
And we shouldn't forget, that man has an amazing capacity

62
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:28,543
for believing the absurd and for selective vision.

63
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,096
I was reminded of this when I heard the Pope

64
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,769
linking Islam and violence, and then saying

65
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:37,508
that “violence is incompatible with the nature of God.”

66
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:41,895
I can only think that the Pope hasn't read the Bible.

67
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,444
Because anyone who has,

68
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:47,352
cannot come to any other conclusion other than:

69
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:51,552
violence is an intrinsic part of the nature of God.

70
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,474
But actually I take my hat off to the Christians,

71
00:03:55,574 --> 00:04:00,346
because they have indeed moved so far away from the teachings of the Middle Ages,

72
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:03,948
that you could almost say it's a different religion.

73
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:08,597
And if Christians can turn things around to such an extent,

74
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:11,696
I don't see why Muslims can't do the same.

75
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:15,054
In fact, they're already starting to do so.

76
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:18,229
And for example, you will find many Muslims now believe

77
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,060
that the Qur'an doesn't say that one is allowed to hit a rebellious wife,

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,362
but that it really says “leave them alone.”

79
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,593
Personally, I find such interpretations absurd.

80
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:33,911
But I don't have a problem with people believing absurd things.

81
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:37,615
I only have a problem with people believing violent things,

82
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:40,548
and trying to impose it on everyone.

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,559
Although, without doubt, political Islam is a huge problem in our day and age,

84
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,862
it would be a grave mistake, let alone a dangerous one,

85
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:54,914
to paint the whole of Islam with one brush.
