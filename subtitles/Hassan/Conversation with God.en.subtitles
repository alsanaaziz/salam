Hi God!
I’m a Muslim,
and I’m having a bit of a crisis of faith at the moment.
What with all the fanatics and the terrorists killing and slaughtering in Your name?
Not to mention things like Hell.
Slavery.
Concubines.
Allowing the hitting of wives.
And death for those who leave Islam.
So I was wondering
if You could help me regain my faith.
All these things are making me wonder whether the Qur’an really is Your literal word.
Maybe I’ve made a mistake.
Maybe Islam is not the real religion of God.
If You wouldn’t mind helping me out here and
show me a sign or a miracle
that would prove that Islam is true,
and the Qur’an really is Your word.
Something really big that would leave me and the rest of humanity in no doubt.
How about
revealing the Qur’an in all languages to every single human being?
– Hmm, weeell I could do that.
Ooor I could do something else like
a praying treeee!
Look! It’s a tree and it’s praying. Isn’t it great?!
– Errhm.
Well, God.
To be absolutely honest, I think it’s a bit naff actually.
What about making a billion trees pray
in every single country
all over the world, so that everyone can see it
and nobody is in any doubt?
I mean, You know, that would really
prove it!
– Nooo, I think just one in a forest in Australia is absolutely fine!
Look,
if that’s not enough,
how about a fish with Allah written on it?
Look! Can you see it? It’s a fish! And it’s got Allaaah written on it!
– Nice, but errm
again, You know, I’m sure You can do better than that, God. I really do.
What about making all the fish all over the world,
errhm, spell the words:
“The Qur’an is really God’s word.
Really!”
In every single language all over the world.
– Nooo, no no, I think the odd fish in a remote part of the world is absolutely fine!
But I’ll tell you what.
I’ll send you a cloud formation that spells Muhammad during the “Milad-un-Nabi” celebrations.
The celebrations of the Prophets birthday.
– Mhhrmm yeaah, I can see that it’s, erhm
it’s a little bit
unclear to be honest with You.
What about
having clouds all over the world
where everyone can see them.
Spelling out:
“Islam is really the true religion and if you don’t believe it you will be roasted in Hell.”
– Nooo, noo, I think one cloud to a gathering of Muslims is absolutely fine,
but here’s another miracle for you.
It’s a praying rock!
Look at that! A rock! Praying!
Can you believe it!?
– Erhm, hrm.
Yeah, well, urh. Ya, I can see that. It’s a kind of a rock.
With a kind of, You know, a hole in the middle of it.
Why don’t You make millions of rocks pray?
And make them stand up and
shout out “Allahu Akbar!”
I mean, You can do that, can’t You? I mean, You’re God, You can do anything.
– Of course, I can do that!
But I much prefer to have just one rock praying. Thank you very much!
Look,
I’m getting a bit pissed off with your bolshy attitude!
Either you believe in me or you don’t, and if you don’t you go to Hell!
– Well, that’s the problem.
If my belief is so crucial to my salvation, why make it so confusing?
Why not make it absolutely clear?
Can You blame people for being confused?
And are You really going to torture them for all eternity?
Simply because they failed to be sure about Islam?
Is that fair, God?
– No, it’s not fair!! But I’m bloody well God! And I can do what I fucking well like!
– True, God.
But I have to decide, whether I believe in such a cruel, sadistic, vindictive and,
quite frankly, vain God.
And quite frankly, I can’t.
So I’m leaving Islam. Good bye!
