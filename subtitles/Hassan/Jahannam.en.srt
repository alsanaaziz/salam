00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,153
Sheikh Alwan: ‘God almighty says in the Noble Qur’an:

2
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:11,038
“Indeed God has cursed the unbelievers

3
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:15,063
and has prepared for them a Blazing Fire,

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:19,077
where they will abide for ever.

5
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:26,089
They will not find in it any friend nor helper.”

6
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,472
It is compulsory to believe in the existence of hell.

7
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:39,824
It is a place that God Almighty has prepared to torture the unbelievers.

8
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:44,573
It is permanent and will never cease to exist.

9
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:50,043
The unbeliever in it will never die and will never escape out of the fire

10
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:55,050
and the punishment of the Fire will never be eased off them.

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:01,291
As God the Lord of the worlds has informed us in his book the Noble Qur’an:

12
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:05,768
“And they will never get out of the Fire” and he — may He be glorified — said:

13
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:12,290
“And its punishment will never be eased off them.”

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,183
So the amount of punishment that the unbeliever receives in hell

15
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:25,188
will never be eased off them for all eternity.’

16
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:30,253
It is impossible for us to imagine eternity

17
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:33,119
but here’s an example

18
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,746
that will give you a glimpse of it.

19
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,669
Imagine that a man comes to

20
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:44,089
a huge desert and picks up one grain of sand.

21
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,255
Then, after a hundred years

22
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,609
the man comes again

23
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,964
and picks up another grain of sand.

24
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:57,218
This goes on every hundred years

25
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:01,448
until all the sand is gone.

26
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:06,703
Now imagine that all this amounts to only

27
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:11,718
the first minute of the first day of eternity.

28
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:14,317
A sane person must ask

29
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:18,348
why would God torture his creation

30
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:21,817
with a torture that never ends.

31
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,603
It makes no sense and

32
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:28,788
serves no benefit or purpose.

33
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:31,143
How can God do this when he is supposed to be

34
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,827
the Most Merciful of those who show mercy?

35
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:37,705
And his mercy encompasses all things.

36
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:42,461
And he is more merciful than a mother towards her child.

37
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:47,920
Is there a mother who’d torture her child, no matter what he had done —

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,492
even for a day — let alone forever?

39
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,447
The god who leaves his creation

40
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,358
in eternal torture,

41
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,792
when he is able to end it,

42
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:06,170
means that he is content with their eternal torture,

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,924
satisfied with their endless suffering.

44
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,642
And if he is the all knowing and all seeing

45
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:17,873
then that means he created billions of humans

46
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:21,592
knowing they would suffer eternal torture.

47
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:25,743
Indeed that is not the God of even a small amount of mercy —

48
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:29,371
let alone the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.

49
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,214
And this is not the God of Justice

50
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:34,898
who keeps himself hidden from his creation

51
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:38,241
then punishes them excessively.

52
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:42,165
Al-Zindani: “...that it is not fair that this torment be eternal,

53
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,582
that however grave the sins that one commits,

54
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:53,015
giving eternal torment for them is much more than they really deserve.

55
00:03:53,115 --> 00:04:00,796
We answer them: those who will be punished and stay forever in the Fire

56
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,318
deserve it because they denied and disbelieved in Allah’s message, and died while insisting on that,

57
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:13,213
and would stay as such if they had been given an everlasting life”

58
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:16,567
So why have this life then?

59
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,150
Isn’t the whole object of it to test mankind?

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,266
And to show that the word has been proven upon him?

61
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:29,896
Isn’t the purpose to show that the unbeliever deserves his punishment?

62
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:35,437
So if God can dispense with testing man after a few years,

63
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:41,951
and if his perfect knowledge is the reason for placing people eternally in hell fire,

64
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:46,762
then why not dispense with this whole charade from the beginning?

65
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:50,140
And spare us this nonsense completely?

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,165
And put the people of paradise into paradise

67
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:58,285
and the people of hell into hell straight away?

68
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,251
If you were to say that the mind is limited

69
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:05,231
and cannot understand the secrets of the unseen

70
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:09,496
and that logic is confined to worldly sciences,

71
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:13,897
I would say yes, of course, and so what?

72
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:17,264
Man doesn’t have anything else other than the mind —

73
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:21,415
God hasn’t given him the ability to know the unseen.

74
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:24,735
So does man deserve punishment

75
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:29,444
for that which is not in his power to understand?

76
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:35,007
And how can we compare between beliefs other than with the mind?

77
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:42,090
And how can we examine the religious claims other than with logic?

78
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:48,755
Is it a principle of Islam to believe in something even though it contradicts reason?

79
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:56,181
And does this principle apply to all religions or only to Islam?

80
00:05:56,499 --> 00:06:04,074
Without doubt the concept of an eternal hell is one of the most absurd concepts invented by man.

81
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:10,613
It contradicts mercy, justice and logic — completely!

82
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,728
But unfortunately

83
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:18,587
it is a concept that preys on the minds of billions of human beings

84
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:23,828
and influences their actions in a negative way.

85
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,080
The time has come for man

86
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,675
to enter the 21st century

87
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:39,283
and to leave the nonsense of all these religions behind him.
